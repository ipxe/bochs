SMP Bochs To Do List
- work on timers
  - if you care that TSC is identical in each processor, you should be able to
      while(true) {
        run one instruction in each CPU
	tick++
      }
  - otherwise run each one a certain amount (called quantum in cosim mode)
    and then increment ticks by the required amount.  But check that the
    ticks are really programmed right.
  - check if #define BX_MEM(x) (bx_mem_array[x]) is the right thing
  - allow # of processors to be defined in .bochsrc.  This requires 
    a CMOS hack and some rombios.c code to produce the SMP config
    structure for a variable number of processors.
