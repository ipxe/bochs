TODO:

1. Check for denormal and pseudodenormal operands in ALL instructions
   I hope all instructions return the same values as real CPU.

2. Unmasked underflow should correct the result by magic number
   for all operations, including float32 and float64.

3. The instructions still implemented using old FPU library:
	 FPATAN, FYL2XP1, FYL2X

4. Set SW_C1 according to PRECISION_UP or PRECISION_DOWN conditions.

5. Drop out FPU_REG data type and use floatx80 only.
