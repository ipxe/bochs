Portable i387 emulator

22 Nov 99  Version 2.02:

First pseudo-portable version for little-endian machines.

Beginning of big-endian support provided through the pre-processor
symbol BIG_ENDIAN.

Some of the code in fpu_entry.c and get_address.c is still in a
non-portable form and these two files still contain assembler code.
