Bxcommit is an easy to use console based tool for committing
redologs into flat
disk  images, particularly  for  use with  Bochs.  It  is
completely  interactive if no command  line arguments  are
used.  It can be switched to a non-interactive mode if all
required parameters are given in the command line.
.SH OPTIONS

it will  appear  in  interactive  mode and  ask   for  all
required parameters to do the commit.
