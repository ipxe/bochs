<h1>Bochs Docbook Documentation Preview</h1>
<P>

The Docbook documentation is divided into three parts:
<ul>
<li><a href="user/book1.html">User's Guide</a></li>
<li><a href="developer/book1.html">Developer's Guide</a></li>
<li><a href="documentation/book1.html">Documentation Guide</a></li>
</ul>

Docbook files can easily be translated into PDF and PostScript.
<!--
however Bryce doesn't have has docbook software installed right, so
he can't produce PDF or PS at present.  When he can make PDF and PS
files, we may want to revert to version 1.3 which had a link to each
book in each format.
