This is a temporary place to paste in stuff that should go into the docs one
day.  When it is transferred into docbook, let's remove it from misc.txt.

Subject: Bochs documentation: loop device

    [ The following text is in the "iso-8859-1" character set. ]
    [ Your display is set for the "US-ASCII" character set.  ]
    [ Some characters may be displayed incorrectly. ]

Hello Bryce,

today I have made some tests with the loop device, because I want to exchange 
files with the bochs disk images. This part of the bochs documentation is 
still missing. This is what I found out:

1.  In the bochs documentation appears the term "loopback". That's not O.K.,
    because the loopback device is a network device. To prevent a mistake, it
    should be renamed.

2.  Using Floppy images is easy, because there is no partition table:

    losetup /dev/loop0 /usr/local/bochs/dlxlinux/floppya.img

    Now you can use the image like a real floppy:

    - format           : mkfs.minix /dev/loop0
    - filesystem check : fsck.minix /dev/loop0
    - mount            : mount /dev/loop0 -o loop /mnt/floppy

    Before you want to restart bochs you must do this:

    losetup -d /dev/loop0

    Don't forget to umount before.

3.  If you want access to a harddisk image, you have to calculate the size of
    the first cylinder. This value is the offset argument for losetup.

    offset = bytes per sector * sectors per cylinder

    The command for dlxlinux image looks like this:

    losetup /dev/loop0 /usr/local/bochs/dlxlinux/hd10meg.img -o 8704

    For images created by bximage you must use the value 32256.

4.  The harddisk image access doesn't work if the image contains more than
    one partition.

5.  I have made this tests with linux and I don't know how
    this could be done with other operating systems.

Bye

Volker

Subject: [Bochs-developers] Documentation - How to make a disk image under
    UNIX/linux

0.) What you need:

1.) An executable version of bochs.  See "obtaining a bochs executable"
or "compiling the bochs source"
2.) The bximage program, included with bochs
3.) A FreeDOS boot disk, or a boot disk from another OS capable of
producing DOS partitions (i.e. a linux install disk.)
4.) (optional) mtools, a program for manipulating DOS disks/images.


1.) Creating an image file.
Run `bximage` to create a disk image file.  You will be greeted with the
following prompt:


========================================================================
                                bximage
                  Disk Image Creation Tool for Bochs
         $Id: misc.txt,v 1.2 2001/10/31 19:49:22 bdenney Exp $
========================================================================

Do you want to create a floppy disk image or a hard disk image?
Please type hd or fd. [hd] 


Since we are creating a hard disk image, accept the default of hd by
pressing <enter> or typing 'hd' and pressing <enter>.  Next, bximage
will ask for the size of the disk image you want to create, in
Megabytes:


Enter the hard disk size in megabytes, between 1 and 32255
[10] 


Enter the size of the hard disk you want to create, and press <enter>. 
Bochs will give you some information about the image it is creating, and
ask you for a filename to use for the file it is creating.  I told it to
use the default of 10 megabytes, and was given the following information
along with the prompt for a filename:


[10] 10

I will create a hard disk image with
  cyl=20
  heads=16
  sectors per track=63
  total sectors=20160
  total size=9.84 megabytes

What should I name the image?
[c.img] 


At this point, type in the filename you want to use for the image.  The
default of "c.img" is appropriate if this will be your only hard disk
image.  After you have typed in the name of the filename you want to
use, press <enter>.  Bximage will tell you it is writing the disk and
will display a status bar as you wait.  When it is finished, it will
give you a final status report and tell you a line that should be added
to your .bochsrc file when you want to use this disk image.  I named my
10 Megabyte image "teaching.img" and the output of bximage looked like
this:


[c.img] teaching.img

Writing: [..........] Done.

I wrote 10321920 bytes to teaching.img.

The following line should appear in your bochsrc:
  diskc: file="teaching.img", cyl=20, heads=16, spt=63


At this point, a file called "teaching.img" was created in my current
directory and is ready to be used as an image file for a bochs session.


2.) Partition and format your image file.

Option 1: Using FreeDOS (Advantages: Creates a MBR on the partition.)

First, you need to edit the .bochsrc file that bochs uses for
configuration information.  Open the file .bochsrc with a text editor. 
Remove any lines in the file beginning with "diskc:".  Add the "diskc:"
line that was displayed when you ran bximage to the .bochsrc file in the
same place that you removed the old "diskc:" lines from.

Also, you need to download or create a FreeDOS (or DOS, or Windows, or
linux) disk image.  Modify the "floppya:" line in your .bochsrc file to point
at the downloaded FreeDOS image and change its status to "status=inserted".

Save and close your .bochsrc.  Now run bochs.  (see: "Running bochs from
the command line.")

Use the standard FreeDOS commands fdisk and format to format your hard
drive image.  You must make the image bootable to be able to boot
without a hard drive.  However, creating a bootable disk image is best
done with a boot disk from the OS you intend to install on the image.



Option 2: Using mtools (Disadvantages: cannot create bootable images
without a MBR image)

Use a text editor to add the following line to the file ~/.mtoolsrc:


drive c: file="<path>/filename.img" partition=1


Save and close .mtoolsrc.  Next, execute the following commands to
create a partition table for the drive image:


mpartition -I -s <spt> -t <cyl> -h <heads> c:
mpartition -cpv -s <spt> -t <cyl> -h <heads> c:

For example, for my 10 meg drive, I used:
mpartition -I -s 63 -t 20 -h 16 c:
mpartition -cpv -s 63 -t 20 -h 16 c:


Next, format the partition you just created using the mformat command:


mformat c:


And you now have a formatted disk image containing a single DOS
partition.
