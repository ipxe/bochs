Testing testing....

This is a temporary place to paste in stuff that should go into the docs one
day.  When it is transferred into docbook, let's remove it from misc.txt.

Subject: usefull info for mounting 


I didn't see this in the doc's so I thought you might like a
short description of how to mount a disk image file into
loopback filesystem for maintenance purposes.

--------------------------------------------

1) First run

fdisk -l <image_name>

... and it should print out a partition table (with a few
complaints requesting the drive geometry, and I don't know
if older versions require a block device) In fact fdisk will
even work to modify partitions in an image, but you must
specify the drive geometry that's in the bocsrc first.

2) Whatever it says the starting partition is, subtract 1
and multiply by 512

3) Type

mount -o loop,offset=<insert number here> <image_name>
/mount/dir

or if it's just a floppy image, just

mount -o loop floppy.img /mount/dir

---------------------------------------------------

I would recommend putting -o ro for read only access if
bochs is in use.  For unusual filesystems you may need to
add a -t <fstype> flag to the mount command to specify the
filesystem type.

see man mount, losetup, and fdisk for more info



BOCHS Rocks!!!
