<chapter><title>Introduction to Bochs</title>
<section id="whatisbochs"><title>What is Bochs?</title>
<para>
Bochs is a program that simulates a complete Intel x86 computer.  It 
can be configured to act like a 286, 386, 486, Pentium, or Pentium Pro.
Bochs interprets every instruction from power-up to reboot, and has
device models for all of the standard PC peripherals: keyboard, mouse,
VGA card/monitor, disks, timer chips, network card, etc.  Because Bochs
simulates the whole PC environment, the the software running in the simulation
"believes" it is running on a real machine.  This approach allows Bochs
to run a wide variety of software with no modification, include most popular
x86 operating systems: Windows 95/98/NT, all Linux flavors, all BSD flavors,
and more.
</para>

<para>
Bochs is written in the C++ programming language, and is designed to run
on many different host platforms<footnote>
<para>
Since Bochs can run on one kind of machine and simulate another machine, we
have to be clear in our terminology to avoid confusion.  The host platform is
the machine that runs the Bochs software.  The guest platform is the operating
system and applications that Bochs is simulating.
</para>
</footnote>, including x86, PPC, Alpha, Sun, and MIPS.  No matter what the
host platform is, Bochs still simulates x86 software.  In other words, it
does not depend on the native instructions of the host machine at all.
This is both a strength and a weakness, and it's the major difference between
Bochs and many other x86 emulation software such as plex86, VMware, etc.
Because Bochs uses software simulation for every single x86 instruction, it
can simulate a Windows application on an Alpha or Sun workstation.  However,
the downside of Bochs's approach is simulation performance.  To model the
processor accurately, Bochs must run many instructions for every simulated x86
instruction, and this makes the simulated machine many times slower than
the physical machine.  Commercial PC emulators (VMware, Connectix, etc.) can
achieve much high emulation speed using a technique called 
virtualization<footnote>
<para>
Virtualization takes advantage of simulating x86 instructions on an
x86 machine, allowing large portions of the simulation to take place
at native hardware speed.  Whenever the simulated machine talks to the
hardware or enters certain privileged modes (such as in kernel code),
the simulator typically takes control and simulates that code in
software at much slower speed, just like Bochs does.
</para>
</footnote>, but they are neither portable to non-x86 platforms nor open
source.  <ulink url="http://www.plex86.org">Plex86</ulink>, Kevin Lawton's
current project, is working toward an open-source x86 simulator with
virtualization.
</para>

<para>
To do anything interesting in the simulated machine, Bochs needs to communicate
with the operating system on the host platform (the host OS).  When you press a
key in the Bochs display window, a key event goes into the device model for the
keyboard.  When the simulated machine needs to read from the simulated hard
disk, Bochs reads from a disk image file on the host machine.  When the
simulated machine sends a network packet to the local network, Bochs uses the
host platform's network card to send the packet out into the real world.  These
interactions between Bochs and the host operating system can be complicated,
and in some cases they are host platform specific.  Sending a network packet in
FreeBSD requires different code than sending the packet in Windows 95, for
example.  For this reason, certain features are supported on some host
platforms and not others.  On Linux, Bochs can simulate a network card that
communicates with the world, but on BeOS the simulated network card may not
work because the communication code between the device model and the BeOS
operating system has not been written.
</para>

<para>
<!-- really more like Background or Bochs History, but maybe it doesn't need its own section unless it gets to 3 paras or so  -->

Bochs was written by Kevin Lawton starting in 1994.  It began as a 
commercial product, which you could buy with source code for $25...
&NEEDHELP; <footnote>
<para>
We need a Bochs historian to help out here.  For background, it would be
interesting to know how much Bochs used to cost and what it was used for.  I
thought I saw an interview out there somewhere where Kevin says why he started
it and some more background information.
</para>
</footnote> Finally, in March 2000, Mandrakesoft bought Bochs and made it open
source under the GNU LGPL.

<!-- 
we should make it clear that Kevin is no longer working on bochs,
but I want to get some more background.  Did he get hired by Mandrakesoft
to do plex86 at the same time as Bochs was bought?  In his linux.com interview
Kevin said: "The only way I can move Bochs to open source is if someone
sponsors that happening. That would be ideal, and would enable me to focus more
on Bochs and FreeMWare, rather than be sidetracked with related consulting
jobs."

The last version of Bochs that he released was 3/25/2000, three days after the
Mandrake press release.
-->
In March 2001, Kevin helped a few developers to move all Bochs activities from
bochs.com to a new site at bochs.sourceforge.net.  Since then the Bochs Project
has settled into its new home, and around release times has even hit #1 most
active project of the week at Source Forge.  
</para> </section>  <!-- end of Introduction:What is Bochs? section -->

<section><title>Who uses Bochs?</title>
<para> It is hard to estimate how many people have tried Bochs or use it on a
regular basis, but a few statistics give an indication.  The <link
linkend="bochs-developers">bochs-developers mailing list</link>, which is the
primary source of news on bugs and releases, has over 300 subscribers.  The
latest version has been downloaded over 40,000 times from SourceForge, not
counting mirrors or CVS users.
</para>

<para>
Bochs has many possible uses, and different people use it for different 
things.  Many people use it to run applications in a second operating system 
without needing two different computers or dual-booting.  Running 
Windows software on a non-x86 workstation or on an x86 UNIX box are common
uses.  Also, because every hardware instruction and every line of simulator
code is accessible, Bochs is used extensively for debugging new operating
systems.  If you were writing boot code for your home-brewed
x86 operating system and it didn't work right, booting it in Bochs could
give you great visibility into what is really going on.  The Bochs 
debugger lets you simulate quickly or slowly, pausing whenever you want
to look at the contents of memory or the CPU registers.  Or, if you 
wanted to study which parts of a program take the most time, you could use
Bochs to measure often pieces of the code were executed.
</para>

<para>
Bochs has been used as a teaching tool in Operating Systems classes, in which
students used and modified it to learn how the PC hardware works.  As a final
project the students had to add a new peripheral device, so they had to learn
all about I/O ports, interrupts, and device drivers.  Also, it has been used as
a reference model to test x86-compatible hardware.  
</para>

<para>
There may be as many uses of Bochs as there are users.  Do you want to run 
your old DOS games?  Or learn to program under Linux, without leaving your
Windows desktop?  Or reverse engineer your printer driver?  You decide.
</para>
</section>  <!-- end of Introduction:Who uses Bochs? section -->

<section><title>Will it work for me?</title>
<para>
Bochs is very useful for some applications, and not well suited to others.
This section tries to answer the question, "Will Bochs work for me?"
</para>

<para> &FIXME; </para>
<!--
I want this section to set reasonable expectations for people before they
try out Bochs.  They should not expect to find blazing speed and complain
to the list because Bochs perfoms so poorly compared to their VMWare demo.
For simulating x86 on x86, if they want blazing speed they should look
at a commercial simulator or plex86 (though it's still in development so
it's not fast yet).

Another factor is ease of setup.  With bochs you have to go editing config
files in a text editor (with a very picky syntax), which is not for 
everybody.

<para>
If you are running on a x86 hardware, you have a range of choices.
Check the installation section for your host platform to see what 
options Bochs supports on your platform<footnote>
<para>
&FIXME; Well, it will when it has been written.
</para>
</footnote>.  Bochs will run on Windows, Linux,
FreeBSD, OpenBSD, or BeOS.  If the most important factor is speed, you may
want to try a virtualization product instead of Bochs (VMware, plex86).
</para>

<para>
If you are using a non-x86 machine, then Bochs is one of the few choices for
running x86 software.  Bochs has been known to work on Solaris (Sparc), 
Linux (PowerPC/Alpha), MacOS (PowerPC), IRIX (MIPS), BeOS (PowerPC), Digital
UNIX (Alpha), and AIX (PowerPC).
</para>
-->

<para>
You can also find more detailed testing information on the testing
status page on the &bochswebsite;.  The testing status page tells which
combinations of host platform and guest platform have been tried by other Bochs
users.

     Tell me about peformance when running bochs?
     </para></question>
     <answer><para>
     Because Bochs emulates every x86 instruction and all the devices in a PC system, it does not reach high emulation speeds. Kevin reported approximately 1.5MIPS using bochs on a 400Mhz PII Linux machine. Users who have an x86 processor and want the highest emulation speeds may want to consider PC virtualization sotware uch as plex86 (free) or vmware (commercial).

     <question><para>
     Does bochs use a disk partition to install the OS?

     <question><para>
     Why can't I use Bochs with my current Win95 installation?

     <answer><para>
     Think about this. If you had two different PC's, they would require different hardware drivers. So you may not be able to safely move a disk drive with Win95 on it, from one to the other. Bochs is no different. It emulates a certain set of hardware devices, and requires each OS be configured for those devices.

<chapter><title>Installation</title>

<section id="downloading"><title>Downloading Bochs</title>

<para>
You can download Bochs from our web site at &bochs-sf-net;.  First, you
need to choose what version to get: a recent release or a development
version.  If you trying to get things working for the first time, a release
version is recommended since it has been tested the most.  The development
versions (sometimes called snapshots) may have some newer bug fixes and new
features, but have not been tested as much as the releases.
</para>

<para>
Second, you can choose to compile Bochs from source code or install a binary
(if one is available for your platform).  Binary packages will be quicker to
install, and most include a small demo of a guest operating system called DLX
Linux to get you started.  However, some features can only be enabled if you
compile Bochs yourself, for example the Bochs debugger.  For multiuser systems,
you will probably need system administrator privileges (root) to install a
binary package.  If you decide to get a binary, download it to your hard disk,
uncompress it, then go to the section called <link
linkend="install-binary">Installing a Binary</link> for more information.
</para>

<para>
If you are going to compile Bochs yourself, you need the gzipped tarball
containing the source code, called
<filename>bochs-<replaceable>version</replaceable>.tar.gz</filename>.  For
Windows and Mac, the prebuilt Makefiles are separate, so also get
the Makefiles for your platform.  To unpack a compressed TAR file<footnote>
<para>
A TAR file is a single file that contains many files packed inside.  Bochs
TAR files are compressed with a program called gzip, and another program
called gunzip is used to uncompress them.
</para>
</footnote> on a Unix machine<footnote>
<para>
On Windows, look for software called WinZip to unpack the TAR.
</para>
</footnote>
, type
<screen>
  gunzip -c bochs-<replaceable>version</replaceable>.tar.gz | tar -xvf -
</screen>
This creates a directory called
<filename>bochs-<replaceable>version</replaceable></filename> full of
files.  This directory will be referred to as &bochsdir;.  Go into
&bochsdir; and you are ready to compile.  Instructions for compiling 
Bochs are in the section, <link linkend="compiling">Compiling Bochs</link>.
</para>

<para>
Alternatively, you can also obtain the sources for any Bochs version using CVS.
See the <link linkend="get-src-cvs">CVS instructions</link> for details.
</para>
</section>  <!-- End of Installation:Downloading Bochs section -->

<section id="get-src-cvs"><title>Tracking the source code with CVS</title>
<para>
CVS, or Concurrent Version System, is a software development tool that helps
to keep track of the different revisions of each file.  It is used by many
open source (and commercial) projects to allow multiple developers to share
their changes to the source code.  The Bochs source code and documentation 
are available using CVS<footnote>
<para>
You can download CVS software and documentation from 
<ulink url="http://www.cvshome.org">www.cvshome.org</ulink>.
</para>
</footnote>.
</para>

<section><title>Checking out Bochs</title>
<para>
When you have CVS installed, the first step is to do a login and checkout.  The
initial checkout command is long and ugly, but usually you only have to do it
once.  The example below shows the CVS checkout process in UNIX.  On the
Windows platform, you can download a CVS client from cvshome.com, or
use CVS within Cygwin<footnote>
<para>
Cygwin is an open source UNIX-like environment for Windows platforms,
available at <ulink url="http://www.cygwin.com">www.cygwin.com</ulink>.

If you have write access to the Bochs CVS tree, the checkout
command is different for you.  See the Developers Guide<footnote>

</para>
</tip>

<tip>
<para>
If you use remote CVS for other projects, you might have already set
the environment variable <varname>CVS_RSH</varname> in your configuration
files.  For the CVS checkout to work as shown above, the
<varname>CVS_RSH</varname> variable should either be empty or set to
<constant>rsh</constant>.
</para>
</tip>

<para>
The CVS checkout process (above) gives you a directory called bochs that
contains the very latest source code.  I will refer to this directory
as &bochsdir;.  In each subdirectory directory there's also a
directory called "CVS" which tells the cvs software where the code was checked
out, what version you have, and where to go for future updates.
</para>
</section>

<section><title>Getting the Latest Version</title>
<para>
Most developers use CVS to always give them the latest source code.  The minute
that any developer checks in a change, they are available to everyone else
through  CVS.  You just have to type <command>cvs update -d -A</command> in the
&bochsdir; directory, and CVS will retrieve any files and directories that have
been changed since you did a checkout.  If you update regularly, each update
takes a short time because it downloads only the files that changed.  The
<command>-d</command> option tells cvs to download new directories that
have been checked in, not just files.  The <command>-A</command> option means
to get the most recent version of each file, as opposed to a release version.
See <link linkend="cvs-release-version">Getting a release version</link>
Both <command>-d</command> and <command>-A</command> can be omitted in many
cases, once you are familiar with the process.  </para>

<para>
The <command>cvs update -A -d</command> command tells you if any new files have
been downloaded from the server, and it also tells you if you have modified any
of the CVS-controlled files.  As it checks through the source directories, it
will list files that have changed, with a single letter before the name that
tells the status of that file.  The most common status letters are listed
below.

	easiest to discard your own edits and download a fresh copy, by

<para>
If you have been using <command>cvs update</command> with "sticky tags" to
retrieve other versions, as described later, cvs will remember which version
you were looking at.  In this case, a <command>cvs update</command> will keep
your sources consistent with that version.  If you want to get back to looking
at the latest code again, be sure to use the <command>-A</command> option to
clears the sticky tags.  </para>

<section id="cvs-release-version"><title>Getting a Release Version</title>

Once you have a CVS checkout, you can also use the update command to
get the Bochs source code for any release since March 2000.  The command
is <command>cvs update -d -r <replaceable>tagname</replaceable></command>.
The tag tells which release you want, and it can be one of the following:

<tip>
<para>
To get a complete list of allowed tags, type <command>cvs stat -v README</command>.  Many of the tags are not generally useful.
</para>
</tip>

Once you have done an update with <command>-r <replaceable>tagname</replaceable></command>, you have made a "sticky tag."  The stickiness refers to the fact
that CVS remembers which tag you have used most recently.  The tag is stored
in the CVS subdirectory, so it stays around even if you log off and
return later.  After creating a sticky tag, any future cvs updates will
try to keep your directory in sync with the version you chose.  In other
words, when developers check in changes you will not
see them because your directory is "stuck" looking at an old version.
To clear the sticky tag, use <command>cvs update -A</command>.
</para>

<para>
A variation on the sticky tag concept is a sticky date<footnote>
<para>
According to some sources, this is when you eat dinner with someone, and
accidently spill a drink on him/her.
</para>
</footnote>.  If some feature was working at some time in the past, but
is no longer working, you can ask CVS to give you the sources from any
date.  <command>cvs update -D 2001-06-14</command> will download the
Bochs source as they were on June 14, 2001.  Again, use <command>-A</command>
to clear the sticky date and track the current sources.
</para>

<title>Linux RPM</title>
<para>
RPM stands for "RedHat Package Manager."  An RPM is a compressed file
containing files to be installed on your system.  Many Linux distributions,
not just RedHat ones, can install files from an RPM.  Debian packages are
available for Bochs as well, but this section talks deals with RPMs.  First,
download the Bochs RPM for your architecture to your computer.  For example, if
you have an Intel-compatible computer, be sure to get the RPM that says "for
Linux x86 distributions."  Once you have the package on your local disk, you
should be able to install it as follows<footnote>
<para>
Many distributions have their own RPM installer program, often graphical, and
they should work as well.  It is helpful to be able to see the text output from
RPM, so if you use a fancy RPM installer, be sure to find the text output and
check that it looks correct.

<section id="compiling"><title>Compiling Bochs</title>

  <section><title>Standard Compile</title>
<para>
Bochs is written in C++, so you need a C++ compiler on your system.  Most
platforms have been tested with GNU gcc/g++, but other compilers also work.
By now, you should have unpacked your source TAR file or checked out Bochs from
CVS.  If not, you can return to <link linkend="downloading">Downloading
Bochs</link> for details.  The top level directory of the source code will be
referred to as &bochsdir;.  (&bochsdir; contains the files
<filename>bochs.h</filename> and <filename>main.cc</filename> and
subdirectories <filename>cpu</filename> and <filename>bios</filename>.) 
</para>

<para>
The standard compile process has three basic steps:
<command>configure</command>, <command>make</command>, and <command>make
install</command>.  Each step is described in a separate section below.  The
standard compile process is used on all Unix machines, MacOS X, BeOS, and Win32
with Cygwin.  There are separate instructions for <link linkend="compiling-win32">compiling for Win32 with Microsoft VC++</link>.
</para>

<section id="configure"><title>Configure</title>

<para>
There is a script called <command>configure</command> which tests your
machine, C/C++ compiler and libraries to discover what settings should work on
your system.  If you run <command>configure</command> with no arguments after
it, defaults will be used for all settings.  To change the settings, you can
run <command>configure</command> with options that override the 
defaults.  You can get a list of valid configure options by typing
<command>configure --help</command>.  All configure options are documented in a
<link linkend="config-opts">later section</link>.  One useful configure
option is --prefix=<replaceable>directory</replaceable>, which sets
the directory in which Bochs will be installed.

</para>

<para>
Among other things, the configure script tries to guess your compiler and
a set of compile options that work.  If you want to control this,
set these environment variables before running configure:
<varname>CC</varname>, <varname>CXX</varname>, <varname>CFLAGS</varname>,
<varname>CXXFLAGS</varname>.  Here is an example that sets the environment
variables, using bash/ksh<footnote>
<para>
The syntax for bash and ksh is given.  In csh and variants, use the syntax
<command>setenv <replaceable>VARIABLE</replaceable>
<replaceable>value</replaceable></command> to change environment variables.
Do not use an equal sign for csh!

syntax:

  export CC=egcs
  export CXX="$CC"
  export CFLAGS="-Wall -O2 -m486 -fomit-frame-pointer -pipe"
  export CXXFLAGS="$CFLAGS"
</screen>
</para>

<para>
Once the <command>configure</command> script knows what options are selected,
it creates a Makefile in every source code directory, and creates 
<filename>$BOCHS/config.h</filename> with all the option values written
as preprocessor #defines.  The sources are ready to compile.
</para>

In the Bochs source directory, there is a series of scripts called
<filename>.conf.<replaceable>platform</replaceable></filename>.
These scripts run <command>configure</command> script for you, with a set of
options that appropriate for that platform.  On some platforms, configure
cannot guess all the right options, so it is necessary to use the shortcut
scripts instead of a plain configure command.  If a
<filename>.conf.<replaceable>platform</replaceable></filename> file exists for
your platform, you should probably use it.

<tip>
<para>
If a shortcut script is "almost right" for you, just edit it and then run it!
If you use a shortcut script, you don't need to run configure manually.  
</para>
</tip>

Run a shortcut script using Bourne shell, like this:
<screen>
  sh .conf.win32-vcpp
</screen>

These <filename>.conf.<replaceable>platform</replaceable></filename> have 
been tested in recent Bochs versions:
<screen>
  .conf.linux
  .conf.sparc
  .conf.macosx
  .conf.win32-vcpp
  .conf.win32-cygwin
  .conf.AIX.4.3.1
  .conf.beos-x86-R4

<section><title>Make</title>
<para>
The <command>make</command> command compiles Bochs.  Make is a program
used by many software projects that reads the &Makefile; in each source
directory and follows the instructions that it finds there.  A &Makefile; tells
which files depend on which other files, what commands to use to compile and
link the code, and more.  After you have finished the configure step, just type
<command>make</command> to build the source code.  
</para> 

<para>
The reason that make is so popular is that it is smart about when to compile
and when not to compile.  If you run make once, it compiles every file.  But
when you run it again, it checks to see if any source files have been modified;
if not, there's nothing to do!  For example, the &Makefile; says that
<filename>main.o</filename> depends on <filename>main.cc</filename>.  Knowing 
this, it will only compile <filename>main.cc</filename> if it is newer than
<filename>main.o</filename>.
</para>

<para>
Of course, make can only do the right thing if the &Makefile; lists all the
dependencies correctly, so human error can sometimes lead make astray.
If make refuses to build something that you think it should, or you 
are getting strange compile errors, try doing <command>make all-clean</command>
and then <command>make</command> again.  All-clean means to clean up
the compiled files in every subdirectory, while <command>make clean</command>
means to clean up just the current directory<footnote>

<para>
This is different from the terminology of some other projects, and it may cause
confusion.  Sometimes "clean" implies that all subdirectories are affected.
</para>
</footnote>.  However, it's important to note that <command>make
all-clean</command> leaves the configuration intact.  You do not have
to run <command>configure</command> again.
</para>

<para>
If you're really in the mood for cleaning, <command>make dist-clean</command>
erases all the configuration information too.  In theory, after a dist-clean
your directory should look much like when you first untarred it or checked it
out.  There's usually some extra stuff lying around, but the &Makefile; tries
at least to erase any files that it created.
</para>

</section>

<section><title>Make Install</title>
<para>
Once the program has been built, the next step is typically to run
<command>make install</command> to copy the executables, documentation, and
other required files into a public place so that all users can use it.
<footnote><para>
&FIXME; We should mention what gets installed, and where.
    /usr/local/bochs/$VERSION/*
    /usr/local/bin/bochs (and bximage)

<section id="compiling-win32"><title>Compiling on Win32 with Microsoft VC++</title>
<para>
The standard compile uses the configure script, but the Windows platform
cannot run the configure script natively.
The currently solution to this problem is that the Bochs
configure script can be run on a different platform that does support
shell scripts, with options that cause it to configure for a Win32 
platform instead of the native one.  Many people have access to a UNIX
machine that could run the configure script, or you can use Cygwin to
run the configure script
<footnote>
<para>
Because Bochs depends so much on the configure script, if you are doing
much win32 Bochs development, you should consider downloading cygwin
so that you can run the configure step natively.
</para>
</footnote>.
</para>

<para>
Download the Bochs sources on a machine that can run shell scripts.
Edit the configure shortcut script <filename>.conf.win32-vcpp</filename>
if you want to adjust configure options.  Then type these commands
in the Bochs source directory:
<screen>
  sh .conf.win32-vcpp
  make win32_snap
</screen>
These commands will run the configure step, produce VC++ makefiles and 
workspace files, and pack it all into a .zip file in the directory above the
source directory <footnote>
<para>
If the source directory is <filename>/home/joe/bochs-win32</filename>, the
resulting .zip file is in <filename>/home/joe/bochs-win32.zip</filename>.
</para>
</footnote>.  The .zip file is all ready to transfer to the target Windows
machine to be unzipped and compiled.  Or, if you run the sh/make steps in
Cygwin, you are already on the target machine so you don't need the .zip
file.
</para>

<para>
When you have the Win32 sources transferred to a Windows machine with VC++,
find the workspace file called <filename>bochs.dsw</filename> and load it in
VC++.  Choose <command>Project:Set Active Project</command> and be sure that
"bochs" is selected.  Then choose <command>Build:Build bochs.exe</command>.
This will build all the required libraries (iodev, cpu, etc.) and the
auxilliary programs <filename>bximage.exe</filename> and
<filename>niclist.exe</filename>.  The workspace compile method is new
in version 1.3, so it has not had very long to be tested and tuned.  Using
workspaces is easy and intuitive, but there is one caveat.  The workspaces
are not currently integrated with configure.  Some configure options such
as --enable-debugger need additional source files to be compiled, and
for now you must add them to the VC++ workspace by hand.  If you add configure
options and start having compile problems, try the nmake method (below)
instead.  These problems should be fixed in future versions.
</para>

<tip>
<para>
To compile with the debugger enabled, add "--enable-debugger" to the
configure line in <filename>.conf.win32-vcpp</filename> before running it.
Then when you have loaded the workspace file, you must add the debug and disasm
libraries to the project dependency list.  Choose
<command>Project:Dependencies</command> and make sure that debug and disasm are
checked.
</para> </tip>

<para>
An alternative way to compile is to run <filename>nmake.exe</filename> in an
MS-DOS window.  Instead of using the workspace files, nmake uses the Bochs
makefiles that are generated by configure.  The workspace file is new in
version 1.3; before that, nmake was the only way to compile Bochs in VC++.
If you are having trouble with the workspace, try the nmake compile instead.
</para>

<para>
The <command>make install</command> for Win32 is presently broken.  In the
future, a <command>make install</command> that runs in Cygwin may be provided.
</para>

<section id="compile-cygwin"><title>Compiling on Win32 with Cygwin</title>
<para>
<para>Cygwin is a free Unix-like environment for Windows written by
Steve Chamberlain and now maintained by RedHat, Inc.  You can download
it from <ulink url="http://www.cygwin.com">www.cygwin.com</ulink>.  Because
Cygwin supports the configure script and uses GNU gcc/g++, you can use the
standard compile process.  A few compiler options are needed, so it is
best to use the configure shortcut script called
<filename>.conf.win32-cygwin</filename>.  Edit the shortcut script if you
want to modify the configure options.  Then, to compile in Cygwin, just type:
<screen>
  sh .conf.win32-cygwin
  make
</screen>
These options are known to work in cygwin, so they are enabled in the configure shortcut file:
<screen>
  --enable-cdrom 
  --enable-sb16=win 
</screen>
</para>
</section>  <!-- end of cygwin -->

<section><title>Compiling on MacOS 9 with CodeWarrior</title>
<para>
Possibly hasn't been tried since 1999.  In theory, you run 
<filename>sh .conf.macos</filename> on a unix box to build the 
makefiles and headers, copy the whole thing over to a Mac, and then
use CodeWarrior to compile.  Since it hasn't been tested in so long,
it is quite likely that some work is needed to bring the Mac port up 
to date.
</para>
</section>

<section><title>Compiling on MacOS X</title>
<para>
The port to MacOS X with Carbon API by Emmanuel Mailliard is quite new, and the
configure and makefile support was added by Bryce Denney.  You need to install
the compiler and libraries from the development tools CD.  It should configure
and compile ok if you use the <filename>.conf.macosx</filename> configure
shortcut script.  MacOS X has a special format for an application bundle, which
looks like a directory that contains the required resource files and binaries.
The Makefile currently creates this application bundle "by hand" using mkdir
and copy, which is surely the wrong way to do it.  Bryce doesn't know the
official way to create an application from a Makefile, so this hack will remain
until a real Mac developer helps to clean it up.
<screen>
  sh .conf.macosx
  make
</screen>
</para>

<note>
<para>
If you have X windows installed, you should also be able to build Bochs
with X windows GUI.  To try it, just run <command>configure</command>
instead of the <filename>.conf.macosx</filename> shortcut script.
</para>
</note>

</section>

<section><title>Compiling on BeOS</title>
<para>
Kevin Lawton ported Bochs to BeOS.  Bernd Korz has taken over the port,
and is working on raw cdrom and raw floppy support.  It should compile if you
configure with --with-beos or use the <filename>.conf.beos-x86-R4</filename>
script.
</para>
</section> <!-- end BeOS -->

<section><title>Compiling on Amiga/MorphOS</title>
<para>
Nicholai Benalal created this port to MorphOS running on Amiga.  It should
compile with <screen>
  ./configure --with-amigaos; make
</screen>
Bryce also made an (untested) <filename>.conf.amigaos</filename> script that
enables FPU and CDROM.
</para>
</section> <!-- end Amiga/MorphOS -->

<section><title>Building an RPM on Linux</title>
<para>
RPM stands for "RedHat Package Manager."  An RPM is a compressed file
containing files to be installed on your system.  The Bochs makefile
has a special make target that can be used to build an RPM of Bochs.
Start with a clean source directory.  Edit .conf.linux first if you want to
adjust the configure options.  Then, type:

<screen>
  su root
  Password:     <replaceable>type root password</replaceable>
  ./build/redhat/make-rpm
</screen>

When this command completes, you will have a source RPM and a binary RPM
of Bochs, probably under <filename>/usr/src/redhat/RPMS</filename>.  The
output of the <command>make rpm</command> will tell you the exact location
of these new files.  Instructions for installing an RPM are <link
linkend="linuxrpm">here</link>.
</para>

</section> <!-- end of Building an RPM -->



<section id="config-opts"><title>Configure Options</title>
<para>
This section describes the configure options for Bochs.  Perhaps the
most important option is <option>--help</option>, since it gives you a list of
all the other options.  The options in the first table choose which GUI library
to use.  The default is <option>--with-x11</option> so if you don't include
<option>--with-*</option> it will try to compile for X windows.

      emulates a drive without media by default.  You can use this option to
      compile in support for accessing the media in your workstation's cdrom
      drive.  The supported platforms are Linux, Solaris, OpenBSD, and Windows.
      For other platforms, a small amount of code specific to your platform
      must be written.  The module iodev/cdrom.cc is the place to add more
      support.  For the most part, you need to figure out the right set of

      keep the Bochs simulation time in sync with real time.  When Bochs
      is executing many instructions, the slowdown timer will have no effect.
      When Bochs is idle, or just waiting around for an interrupt, the 
      slowdown timer kicks in to prevent Bochs time from speeding ahead.
      This should solve problems like, "Why does my screen saver turn on

      around for an interrupt, the idle code uses a select() loop and some
      X11 tricks to wait until user input arrives.  This is designed to 
      keep Bochs responsive while still yielding to other processes when
      Bochs is idle.

      partial images in as a sequence (win95-2, win95-3, etc.) and opens them
      all.  Then, it treats the series as if there was a single large file
      created by "cat win95-1 win95-2 win95-3".  This trick works for both
      diskc and diskd.  All files must be a multiple of 512 bytes.

      By changing to more than 1 processor, you enable SMP simulation.  This
      allows you to boot Linux and maybe other OSes in SMP mode, and bochs will
      simulate all the different CPUs and communication between them.  Do not
      expect this option to speed up your simulation!  On the contrary, it has
      to spend extra time simulating the different CPUs (even if they're mostly
      idle) and the communication between them.  Use it to try out an SMP OS if
      you don't have an SMP machine, or to debug SMP OS drivers.  Click

      In an SMP machine, there is an APIC (Advanced Programmable Interrupt
      Controller) built into each processor and a separate I/O APIC.  The
      APICs are used for inter-processor communication, so they must be
      enabled for SMP to work.  The default is "no" when there is one
      processor and "yes" when there is more than one processor.  Normally,
      the default is correct and you would never need to type this option.

      don't want this option.  When debugging, it is very helpful to have
      deterministic execution, and the clock is something that can skew
      determinism.  If you supply this option, pass it a value returned by the
      time(NULL) call, relating to the time you want bochs to start the CMOS
      clock from.  For instance, '--enable-time0=917385580'.  If you use this
      option but don't provide a value, configure uses a default value.  Note
      that the time0 option in .bochsrc will override this value.  Without this
      option, the CMOS clock uses a time0 based on the value of time(NULL),
      which is probably what you want.

   <section>
   <title>bochsrc</title>
<para>
Bochs uses a configuration file called a <filename>bochsrc</filename> to know
where to look for disk images, how the Bochs emulation layer should work, etc.
When you first start up Bochs, it looks around for its configuration file, and
parses it.  Here are a few lines from a sample file:
<screen>
  diskc: file="30M.sample", cyl=615, heads=6, spt=17
  boot: c
</screen>
The format is very strict, so be sure to put the right number of spaces and
use lowercase letters.  As you can see, most lines have a keyword telling what
is being configured, followed by a colon, followed by a few
<varname>variable</varname>=<varname>value</varname> pairs, separated by
commas.  For very simple options, sometimes just a single value is needed.  
The source and binary distributions come with a sample
<filename>bochsrc</filename>, so you can just copy the sample file and edit the
settings you need to change.
</para>

</para>

<section><title>romimage</title>
<para>
Examples:
<screen>
  file=bios/BIOS-bochs-latest, address=0xf0000
</screen>
You need to load a ROM BIOS into addresses 0xf0000-0xfffff.  The BIOS controls
what the PC does when it first powers on.  Normally, you can use a precompiled
BIOS in the source or binary distribution called
<filename>BIOS-bochs-latest</filename>.

<para>
Examples:
<screen>
  megs: 32

Set this to the default number of megabytes of memory you want to emulate.  The
default is 32, since most operating systems won't need more than that.

<section><title>vgaromimage</title>
<para>
Examples:
<screen>
  vgaromimage: bios/VGABIOS-elpin-2.40

Elpin Systems, Inc. is provided in the source and binary distributions.

<section><title>floppya/floppyb</title>
<para>
Examples:
<screen>
2.88M 3.5" Floppy:
  floppya: 2_88=a:, status=inserted
1.44M 3.5" Floppy:
  floppya: 1_44=floppya.img, status=inserted
1.2M  5.25" Floppy:
  floppyb: 1_2=/dev/fd0, status=inserted
720K  3.5" Floppy:
  floppya: 720k=/usr/local/bochs/images/win95.img, status=inserted
</screen>

Floppya is the first drive, and floppyb is the second drive. If you're booting
from a floppy, floppya should point to a bootable disk.  To read from a disk
image, write the name of the image file.  In many operating systems Bochs can
read directly from a raw floppy drive.  For raw disk access, use the device
name (Unix systems) or the drive letter and a colon (Windows systems).

You can set the initial status of the media to <constant>ejected</constant> 
or <constant>inserted</constant>.  Usually you will want to use 
<constant>inserted</constant>.  In fact Bryce can't think of any reason
to ever write <constant>ejected</constant> in your bochsrc.
</para>
</section>

<section><title>diskc/diskd</title>
<para>
Examples:
<screen>
  diskc: file=10M.img, cyl=306, heads=4, spt=17
  diskc: file=112M.img, cyl=900, heads=15, spt=17
  diskd: file=483.img, cyl=1024, heads=15, spt=63
</screen>

The diskc/diskd lines tell Bochs what disk image file to use as the constants
of the emulated hard drive, and what geometry it should have.  Diskc is the
first hard drive, and diskd is the second hard drive.  At present, using a raw
hard drive is NOT SUPPORTED and dangerous to your data.  The file should be a
disk image file, which must be exactly 512*cyl*heads*spt bytes long.  The
geometry settings are cylinder (cyl), heads, and sectors per track (spt).  If
you  use bximage  to create   the  image,  it  will give  you  the required
cyl,  head, and spt information.

<note><para>

  cdromd: dev=e:, status=inserted                 (Windows only)
  cdromd: dev=cdromimage.iso, status=inserted
</screen>

The cdromd line tells Bochs to emulate a CD-ROM device.  You cannot have
both a diskd and a cdromd, and there is no cdromc option.

<section><title>debug/info/error/panic</title>
<para>
Examples:
<screen>
  debug: action=ignore
  info: action=report
  error: action=report
  panic: action=ask
</screen>

During simulation, Bochs encounters certain events that the user might want to
know about.  These events are divided into four levels of importance: debug,
info, error, and panic.  Debug messages are usually only useful when writing
Bochs code or when trying to locate a problem.  There may be thousands of debug
messages per second, so be careful before turning them on.  Info messages tell
about interesting events that don't happen that frequently.  Bochs produces an
"error" message when it  finds a condition that really shouldn't happen,  but
doesn't endanger the simulation.  An example of an error  might be  if the
emulated  software produces an illegal disk command.  Panic messages mean that
Bochs cannot simulate correctly and should probably shut down.
A panic can be a configuration problem (like a misspelled bochsrc line) or an
emulation problem (like an unsupported video mode).  
</para>


<para>
The debug, info, error, and panic lines in the bochsrc control what Bochs will
do when it encounters each type of event.  The allowed actions are: fatal
(terminate bochs), ask (ask the user what to do), report (print information to
the console or log file), or ignore (do nothing).  The recommended settings are
listed in the sample above.
</para>

<tip>
<para>
The safest action for panics is "fatal" or "ask".  If you are getting lots of
panics and get tired of telling it to continue each time, you can try
action=report instead.  If you allow Bochs to continue after a panic, don't
be surprised if you get strange behavior or crashes after a panic occurs.
Please report panic messages to the bochs-developers mailing list unless it is
just a configuration problem like "could not find hard drive image."

Video memory is scanned for updates and screen updated every so many virtual

<para>
Bochs-announce is a moderated, low-traffic list which carries only periodic
announcements of Bochs releases and important events.  If you have a very
important and truly relevant Bochs announcement, you can try posting it to
bochs-announce, but the moderator will have to approve it before it will 
go out.  On average, bochs-announce subscribers get one or two messages
per month.  There are about 75 subscribers.  Anyone may join the list.

<section><title>Mailing List Etiquette</title>

<para>
Here are a few guidelines for use of the Bochs mailing lists:
</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem> <para>
Please check the documentation before asking questions, but on this list you
are very UNLIKELY to get flamed and insulted for being a Bochs beginner.
Sending commercial promotions to the list probably will get you some angry
responses though.
</para> </listitem>

<listitem> <para>
Also, keep in mind that messages are limited to 40K, so if you want to share a
large screen shot or disk image, put it on a web or FTP site and tell people
how to find it.  Patches are usually small enough that they aren't a problem,
especially if compressed.
</para> </listitem>

<listitem> <para>
Distribution of copyrighted material, or even offers to distribute copyrighted
material WILL NOT be tolerated.  The Bochs Project does not distribute
any software (disk images) in violation of the license agreement, and users who
do so will be warned first and then blocked from the list if it happens again.
As an open source project, we rely on donated services from Source Forge and
other groups, and we can't afford to put them or ourselves at risk of legal
action.
</para> </listitem>

<listitem> <para>
It is possible to subscribe and unsubscribe by email.  If you do this, you must
write to bochs-announce-request or bochs-developers-request.  Don't forget the
"-request" part or your subscribe message will go to 300+ people.

<para>
This was contributed by Greg Alexander in October 2001.

0.) What you need:

1.) An executable version of bochs.  See "obtaining a bochs executable"
or "compiling the bochs source"
2.) The bximage program, included with bochs
3.) A FreeDOS boot disk, or a boot disk from another OS capable of
producing DOS partitions (i.e. a linux install disk.)
4.) (optional) mtools, a program for manipulating DOS disks/images.


1.) Creating an image file.
Run `bximage` to create a disk image file.  You will be greeted with the
following prompt:


========================================================================
                                bximage
                  Disk Image Creation Tool for Bochs
========================================================================

Do you want to create a floppy disk image or a hard disk image?
Please type hd or fd. [hd] 


Since we are creating a hard disk image, accept the default of hd by
pressing <command>Enter</command> or typing 'hd' and pressing
<command>Enter</command>.  Next, bximage will ask for the size of the disk
image you want to create, in Megabytes:


Enter the hard disk size in megabytes, between 1 and 32255
[10] 


Enter the size of the hard disk you want to create, and press
<command>Enter</command>. 
Bochs will give you some information about the image it is creating, and
ask you for a filename to use for the file it is creating.  I told it to
use the default of 10 megabytes, and was given the following information
along with the prompt for a filename:


[10] 10

I will create a hard disk image with
  cyl=20
  heads=16
  sectors per track=63
  total sectors=20160
  total size=9.84 megabytes

What should I name the image?
[c.img] 


At this point, type in the filename you want to use for the image.  The
default of "c.img" is appropriate if this will be your only hard disk
image.  After you have typed in the name of the filename you want to
use, press <command>Enter</command>.  Bximage will tell you it is writing the disk and
will display a status bar as you wait.  When it is finished, it will
give you a final status report and tell you a line that should be added
to your .bochsrc file when you want to use this disk image.  I named my
10 Megabyte image "teaching.img" and the output of bximage looked like
this:


[c.img] teaching.img

Writing: [..........] Done.

I wrote 10321920 bytes to teaching.img.

The following line should appear in your bochsrc:
  diskc: file="teaching.img", cyl=20, heads=16, spt=63


At this point, a file called "teaching.img" was created in my current
directory and is ready to be used as an image file for a bochs session.


2.) Partition and format your image file.

Option 1: Using FreeDOS (Advantages: Creates a MBR on the partition.)

First, you need to edit the .bochsrc file that bochs uses for
configuration information.  Open the file .bochsrc with a text editor. 
Remove any lines in the file beginning with "diskc:".  Add the "diskc:"
line that was displayed when you ran bximage to the .bochsrc file in the
same place that you removed the old "diskc:" lines from.

Also, you need to download or create a FreeDOS (or DOS, or Windows, or
linux) disk image.  Modify the "floppya:" line in your .bochsrc file to point
at the downloaded FreeDOS image and change its status to "status=inserted".

Save and close your .bochsrc.  Now run bochs.  (see: "Running bochs from
the command line.")

Use the standard FreeDOS commands fdisk and format to format your hard
drive image.  You must make the image bootable to be able to boot
without a hard drive.  However, creating a bootable disk image is best
done with a boot disk from the OS you intend to install on the image.



Option 2: Using mtools (Disadvantages: cannot create bootable images
without a MBR image)

Use a text editor to add the following line to the file ~/.mtoolsrc:


drive c: file="<replaceable>path</replaceable>/filename.img" partition=1


Save and close .mtoolsrc.  Next, execute the following commands to
create a partition table for the drive image:


mpartition -I -s <replaceable>spt</replaceable> -t <replaceable>cyl</replaceable> -h <replaceable>heads</replaceable> c:
mpartition -cpv -s <replaceable>spt</replaceable> -t <replaceable>cyl</replaceable> -h <replaceable>heads</replaceable> c:

For example, for my 10 meg drive, I used:
mpartition -I -s 63 -t 20 -h 16 c:
mpartition -cpv -s 63 -t 20 -h 16 c:


Next, format the partition you just created using the mformat command:


mformat c:


And you now have a formatted disk image containing a single DOS
partition.

<section> <title>Linux: Mounting a disk image using the loop device</title>
<para>
This section was contributed by Volker Ruppert.  It describes how to
access a floppy or hard disk image within Linux using the loop device.
Why would you want to do this?  Let's say you have made a small Linux 
disk image for Bochs, and you want to install some more software on it.
You have already downloaded the software onto your real system, so now
you want to transfer it to the Bochs disk image.  A fast way to transfer
the files is to mount the disk image using the loop device.
</para>
<para>
Here is what Volker writes:
<screen>
Today I have made some tests with the loop device, because I want to exchange 
files with the bochs disk images.  This is what I found out:

1.  Using Floppy images is easy, because there is no partition table:

    losetup /dev/loop0 /usr/local/bochs/dlxlinux/floppya.img

    Now you can use the image like a real floppy:

    - format           : mkfs.minix /dev/loop0
    - filesystem check : fsck.minix /dev/loop0
    - mount            : mount /dev/loop0 -o loop /mnt/floppy

    Before you want to restart bochs you must do this:

    losetup -d /dev/loop0

    Don't forget to umount before.

2.  If you want access to a harddisk image, you have to calculate the size of
    the first cylinder. This value is the offset argument for losetup.

    offset = bytes per sector * sectors per cylinder

    The command for dlxlinux image looks like this:

    losetup /dev/loop0 /usr/local/bochs/dlxlinux/hd10meg.img -o 8704

    For images created by bximage you must use the value 32256.

3.  The harddisk image access doesn't work if the image contains more than
    one partition.

4.  I have made this tests with linux and I don't know how
    this could be done with other operating systems.

<section><title>Simulating a Multiprocessor Machine</title>
<para>
Bochs can now simulate an SMP machine when you use "--enable-processors=N" 
in the configure command.  SMP support was added by Bryce Denney, who
was very interested in watching a multiprocessor operating system work 
at a low level.  It should also be helpful to operating system developers
who are writing SMP drivers, or just for users who want to test drive
an SMP machine to see what it looks like.
</para>

<para>
It is important to understand that configuring bochs for 4 processors will NOT make
your single-threaded applications run faster in general!  On the contrary, it
has to spend time simulating idle processors as well as the ones doing your
task.  The point is to simulate an SMP system, not to speed up a uniprocessor
application.
</para>

<para>
What was required to make SMP work in Bochs?  (Note that only Linux 2.2
has been tested so far.)

(The apic is not the only problem!)
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>
A number of people have suggested using threads to simulate each CPU in
a different thread.  Then on a real SMP machine, the threads can execute
in parallel.  This is a great idea, but it's not done at present.

<section><title>Setting Up Networking in DLX Linux</title>
<para>
All Bochs binaries come with a working version of DLX Linux.  This section
describes how to configure networking in Bochs and enable it within
DLX Linux.  First you must add a <varname>ne2k</varname> line in your bochsrc
file.  Then, when you boot the DLX Linux image, you need to type some Linux
commands to set up an IP address, a network route, and a name server.
</para>

<para>
When you have an <varname>ne2k</varname> line in your bochsrc file, Bochs 
will emulate a network card called an NE2000.  Below are some examples of valid
<varname>ne2k</varname> lines for various operating systems.  Choose the
one that's closest to what you need, add it to your bochsrc file, and 
edit the values if necessary.
<screen>
  # sample for FreeBSD
  ne2k: ioaddr=0x280, irq=9, mac=b0:c4:20:00:00:00, ethmod=fbsd, ethdev=xl0
  # sample for Linux
  ne2k: ioaddr=0x280, irq=9, mac=b0:c4:20:00:00:00, ethmod=linux, ethdev=eth0
  # sample for Windows
  ne2k: ioaddr=0x280, irq=9, mac=00:c4:3B:00:C3:00, ethmod=win32, ethdev=NE2000
</screen>
You see the pattern.  Usually you won't need to change the I/O address, IRQ
number, or MAC address.  The <varname>ethmod</varname> value depends on your
host operating system, and it must be either <constant>null</constant>,
<constant>fbsd</constant> (for FreeBSD or OpenBSD), <constant>linux</constant>,
or <constant>win32</constant>.  The <varname>ethdev</varname> setting is the
name of the network interface on your system, and is also OS-dependent.  On
UNIX systems you can get the name of the network interface by running
<command>ifconfig</command>.  (Don't choose the loopback interface.)  On
Windows systems, the correct ethdev setting is not always obvious, so we
provide a utility called <command>niclist</command> to list the names of
network interfaces to use.  When you run <command>niclist</command>, it will
suggest an <varname>ne2k</varname> line which is a very good first try.
</para>

<para>
Next, if you are on a UNIX machine you will need to become the root user.
Since bochs is sending and receiving raw network packets, you need to be root
to use the network device.  To allow normal users to do this would be a
security problem.
</para>

<para>
Now run Bochs to boot DLX Linux.  Press enter a few times to accept the default
configuration choices.  This tells Bochs read the configuration file and then
begin.  DLX Linux should boot in the Bochs window, and you should see
that Linux detects the NE2000 card.  Eventually it gets to a login prompt.
<screen>
  ne.c:v1.10 9/23/94 Donald Becker (becker@cesdis.gsfc.nasa.gov)
  NE*000 ethercard probe at 0x280: b0 c4 20 00 00 00
  eth0: NE2000 found at 0x280, using IRQ 9.
</screen>

<para>
At the login prompt, type "root" to log in as root. Then type the ifconfig and
route commands to set up networking.  The exact IP numbers in the example won't
work for you; you must choose an IP configuration that is legal on your
network.

<screen>
  dlx login: root
  Linux 1.3.89.
  dlx:~# ifconfig eth0 192.168.0.99         # set bochs IP address
  dlx:~# route add -net 192.168.0.0         # first 3 numbers match IP
  dlx:~# route add default gw 192.168.0.1   # your gateway to the net
  dlx:~# _
</screen>

<note>
<para>
The bochs IP address must be an unused IP address on your
network.  If you duplicate someone else's IP address, your network will
become very confused.
</para>
</note>

<para>
Finally, the network is ready and you can test it out with ping, telnet, or ftp
to various machines by their numerical IP address.  Keep in mind that for all
UNIX host platforms, Bochs networking cannot talk to the host machine.  That
means the host machine can't be the gateway either.  You need another physical
machine on the network that bochs can talk to.  On Win32 this restriction does
not apply.
</para>

<note>
<para>
When you have a working network configuration, you can make DLX Linux recreate
the same settings the next time you boot.  Just add the ifconfig and route
commands to the end of /etc/rc.d/rc.inet1.  I won't try to describe how
to use the <command>vi</command> editor in this limited amount of space...
</para>
</note>



<para>
To configure a name 
server, set up <filename>/etc/resolv.conf</filename> with the IP address of
your name server as shown.

<section><title>Accessing your CDROM</title>
<para>
To access your CDROM in DOS, you must download an IDE CDROM driver.  
Bochs emulates a very generic CDROM drive, and several drivers are known to
work.  Others don't.  This section describes how to set up your
<filename>config.sys</filename> and <filename>autoexec.bat</filename> to enable
the CDROM.
</para>

<para>
The drivers that have been reported to work are
<filename>OAKCDROM.SYS</filename> that comes with several versions of Windows
and <filename>SBIDE.SYS</filename> version 1.21 from Creative
Labs<footnote>
<para>
To get it, go to <ulink url="http://creative.com">Creative Labs web
site</ulink>, click on Support, then click Download Files.  You get to a screen
where you must select the operating system and the product for which you want
the driver.  Choose DOS as the operating system, and "CD-ROM: 4x and above" as
the product.  There are several choices, but you want
<filename>sbide121.exe</filename> from April 15, 1997.  Version 2.0 does not
work.  The download file is a self-extracting ZIP file, so you will need to run
it in DOS or Windows.  If you can copy it onto the DOS floppy disk image, you
can even boot DOS inside Bochs and run <filename>sbide121.exe</filename> to
extract it.  The driver is called SBIDE.SYS.  </para>
</footnote> and OAKCDROM.SYS that comes with several versions of Windows.
Copy the driver to your boot disk, and then set up the startup files as follows.
<para>
<screen>
config.sys:
  device=himem.sys
  device=oakcdrom.sys /D:CD001
      -or-
