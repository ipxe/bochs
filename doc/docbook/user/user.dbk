<chapter><title>What is Bochs?</title>
   <section><title>I don't know whant to call this section...</title>
      <para>
      Bochs is a portable x86 PC emulation software package that emulates
      enough of the x86 CPU, related AT hardware, and BIOS to run DOS,
      Windows '95, Minix 2.0, and other OS's, all on your workstation.
      </para>

      <para>
      Bochs is an open source project distributed under the GNU Lesser General
      Public License. It was originally a commercial product, but in
      March 2000 MandrakeSoft bought Bochs and committed it to Open Source.
      Here is the press release.
      </para>

      <para>
      Bochs now compiles/runs on many platforms. See the following list for
      supported platforms and special notes:

            the build process
            for Win32. You can compile with either the MS Visual C++ 5.0
            or GNU-Win32 environments. Go to Compiling Bochs on Win32 </entry>

            <entry>David Batterham drbatter@socs.uts.edu.au or
            drbatter@yahoo.com ported bochs to the Mac. His changes are
            integrated, though it is work in progress. 
            He compiled with CodeWarrior
            Pro R1 (CW12), and included a project file 'Bochs.proj'
            in the top-level
            directory of source code, which you may need to modify. I
            added a '--with-macos' option to configure, so you can use a Unix
            machine to generate header files for the Mac. Check out David's
            MacBochs website. David has not had time to maintain the page or the
            Mac port since early 2000. If you have Mac 
            development tools and want
            to contribute, contact the developers list. </entry>

       Yes! Bochs is released under the <ulink url="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lesser.html">GNU LGPL</ulink>,

     <question>
       <para>How do you pronounce "bochs"?</para>
     </question>
     <answer>
       <para>
       Phonetically the same as the English word "box". It's just a play on the word "box", since techies like to call their machines a "Linux box", "Windows box", ... Bochs emulates a box inside a box.

     <question>
       <para>Who is the author of bochs?</para>
     </question>
     <answer>
       <para>
       Kevin Lawton is the primary author of bochs. There have been bug fixes, enhancements, and code contributions from some few hundred people, so it is not possible to list them all. Kevin is presently working on a PC virtualization project called <ulink url="http://www.plex86.org">plex86</ulink> and no longer maintain bochs.

  <qandaentry>
     <question><para>
     Who maintains bochs now?
     </para></question>
     <answer><para>
      With Kevin's help, in April 2001, the members of the bochs-developers mailing list set up a new official bochs site hosted by <ulink url="http://sourcefourge.net">Source Forge</ulink>. The current admins on this project are Bryce Denney and Greg Alexander.

  </qandaentry>

  <qandaentry>
     <question><para>
     Tell me about peformance when running bochs?
     </para></question>
     <answer><para>
     Because Bochs emulates every x86 instruction and all the devices in a PC system, it does not reach high emulation speeds. Kevin reported approximately 1.5MIPS using bochs on a 400Mhz PII Linux machine. Users who have an x86 processor and want the highest emulation speeds may want to consider PC virtualization sotware uch as plex86 (free) or vmware (commercial).

  <qandaentry>
     <question><para>
     Does bochs use a disk partition to install the OS? 
     </para></question>
     <answer><para>
     No. You use a disk image file, which is simply a large file, like any other file, on your platform's disk. 
     </para></answer>
  </qandaentry>

  <qandaentry>
     <question><para>
     Why can't I use Bochs with my current Win95 installation? 
     </para></question>
     <answer><para>
     Think about this. If you had two different PC's, they would require different hardware drivers. So you may not be able to safely move a disk drive with Win95 on it, from one to the other. Bochs is no different. It emulates a certain set of hardware devices, and requires each OS be configured for those devices.

     Supposedly yes.  There is emulation for an NE2000 NIC in the current
releases, though I have not heard whether it works or not.  If you try it,
please fill out a testing form or bug report.

   worked:

  All releases are gzip'd tar files. That means the whole Bochs source code directory has been consolidated into one file using the Unix command 'tar', then compressed to save space with GNU 'gzip'. To extract the source code, you'll need both 'tar' and 'gzip/gunzip'. All files are contained within one subdirectory named 'bochs-YYMMDDv'.
