I now have a permanent licensing agreement with Elpin Systems (http://www.elpin.com)
to use and distribute this binary VGA BIOS with and *only* with Bochs.

You may NOT use this version of their VGA BIOS for any purposes
other than within the Bochs x86 emulator, without the permission of
Elpin Systems.

From what I've seen from Elpin Systems, their code is very
accurate, and I highly recommend them if you're looking
for precise (S)VGA emulation.  Also they have entertainment
software.  An excerpt from their Web site:

      Elpin Systems is a manufacturer of software located in San Jose,
    California. The Elpin Systems Entertainment Division is committed to
      developing and delivering quality Windows applications into the
                  productivity and entertainment markets.

   The Systems Division has developed a line of VGA development tools and
    products, including the "VGA Core Test Suite", the "VGA Core Sample
                    Implementation", and the "VGA BIOS".
