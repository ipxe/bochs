Help on installing Minix 2.0 in Bochs
</CENTER>
</H1>

<PRE>
For questions about Minix in general, to obtain Minix distribution files,
and other issues, check out <A HREF="http://www.cs.vu.nl/~ast/minix.html">http://www.cs.vu.nl/~ast/minix.html</A>

<B>NOTE: Please read message regarding licensing of software packages
    which you run within Bochs, and use of temporary files created to
    facilitate installation. <A HREF="3rdparty.license.html">3rd Party Software Licensing and Temporary Files</A></B>

What you will need before you start:

  * ROOT, USR
    Minix 2.0 ROOT & USR boot floppy image files.  These image
    files represent a bootable Minix root (/) floppy, and a (/usr)
    partition - just enough to get you up and running to begin
    installing the rest.

  * USR.TAZ (The rest of the necessary Minix distribution files to provide
             a full Minix system.)

  * SYS.TAZ (optional) system sources
  * CMD.TAZ (optional) command sources

  * A '.bochsrc' files something like:

      megs: 8
      boot: c
      diskc: file=../30M.minix2.0, cyl=615, heads=6, spt=17
      floppya: 1_44=../1.44
      #log: /dev/null
      log: ./bochs.out
      hga_update_interval: 250000
      keyboard_serial_delay: 200
      vgaromimage: bios/VGABIOS-elpin-2.00A
      romimage: bios/rombios.bin

  * Compile Bochs and setup for the Minix environment
    <A HREF="install.html#Compiling source code">Compiling source code</A>
    <A HREF="install.html#Setting up environment">Setting up environment before running</A>

Getting down to business, you need to break up the 'USR.TAZ' distribution
into chunks big enough to fit on your 1.44Meg floppy.  Use "dd" for this.
Basically you supply a block-size of 1.44Megs, read in and write out only
one block (the size of a whole floppy).  You have to do this multiple
times, each time telling "dd" to skip one more chunk than before.  I
had to create 3 files, the last of which will be only partially full:

  dd if=USR.TAZ of=USR.00 bs=1440k count=1 skip=0
  dd if=USR.TAZ of=USR.01 bs=1440k count=1 skip=1
  dd if=USR.TAZ of=USR.02 bs=1440k count=1 skip=2


Create a combined root/usr boot floppy.  Combined,
both files equal the size of a 1.2Meg floppy, but you
can just combine them and use them as a 1.44Meg floppy.

  cat ROOT USR > 1.44    # same path as 'floppya:' directive in '.bochsrc'.

Create an empty 30Meg hard disk image file with same path
as 'diskc:' directive in '.bochsrc'.

  dd if=/dev/zero of=30M.minix2.0 bs=512 count=62730

Boot from the root/usr floppy boot floppy.

  bochs boot:a

At the boot monitor, type '=' key to continue.

  Minix boot monitor 2.5

  Press ESC to enter the monitor

  Hit a key as follows:

      =  Start Minix

Minix will partially boot, then ask:

  Finish the name of device to mount as /usr: /dev/

Type 'fd0c', which is the second (/usr) partition on the boot floppy
you made (the USR disk).

Minix should be fully booted to the login prompt:

  noname login:

Type 'root', no password is needed.

Now, since I don't yet support hardware scrolling under VGA text
emulation, type the F3 key, which will turn on software scrolling.
The following message will be displayed:

  Software scrolling enabled.

You can type an optional Return, to get to a new line, since that
message popped up, but you don't need to.

Now enter the setup utility, by typing 'setup'.
A series of notes are printed and a ':'.  After you read the
messages, type a Return.

Minix now asks you what kind of keyboard you have.  Type Return
to accept the default (us-std).

You are now informed that you'll be put in the program 'part',
which can partition your hard disk image file for you.  Just
type 'Return'.

You should be in 'part'.  Type 'r', to read the partition table off
of /dev/hd0.  Don't worry about a message like

  'dev/hd0: Invalid partition table (reset).

Since you have a blank disk image, that is to be expected.
Unfortunately, I don't implement the cursor for VGA text mode yet,
so you'll have to trust me on this one.  Type:

  'down-arrow' once displays "Active flag" in the top left corner
  'right-arrow' once displays "Hex partition type"
  '8' '1'  displays a partition type of "MINIX"
  'right-arrow' over until "Starting Head" is displayed
  '1' to change the starting head to 1 (leave track #0 free)
  'right-arrow' over until "Kb" is displayed
  'm' until the fields are maximized

  'w' to write partition table to disk.

  (you'll see a warning message)
  Warning: About to write a new table on /dev/hd0
           Save partition table? (y/n)

  'y' to accept
  'q' to quit "part" program

Minix should be now asking you to type in the partition you created:

  Please finish the name of the primary partition you have created:
  (Just type RETURN if you want to rerun "part")                  /dev/

Type 'hd1' and Return to complete the device path.  A message is then
displayed telling you setup will carve up the partition you just created,
into two sub-partitions.  This is OK.  Type Return.

  Scanning /dev/hd1c for bad blocks...

You can let this take it's course or type the 'Del' key if it works,
to skip.  Next setup wants to know about your memory size.

  What is the memory size of this system in kilobytes? [4096 or more]

Providing you're running Bochs emulating >= 4Megs of memory, just type Return.
Now you should see the final message:

  Please insert the installation ROOT floppy and type 'halt' to exit Minix.
  You can type 'boot hd1' to try the newly installed Minix system.  See
  "TESTING" in the usage manual.

You already have the root/boot floppy image in place.  Type 'halt'.
Then type 'boot hd1', then '=' at the boot monitor to continue with the
boot.  You should be back at the login prompt, only this time you just
booted from the hard disk image.

  noname login:

Login as root, no password needed.

NOTE: You'll need to keep typing the F3 key to turn on Software
      Scrolling every time you fire up Minix.  Type it now.

Complete the setup process by typing 'setup /usr'.

  What is the size of the images on the diskettes? [all]

Type Return, since you're using the whole diskette.

  What floppy drive to use? [0]

Type Return since you're using floppy #0. (A:)

  Please insert input volume 1 and hit return

OK, now whenever setup asks for a new volume, you just go to
your workstation, and copy the next volume in the series, overwriting
the 1.44Meg floppy image file.

  unix-> cp USR.00 /path/1.44

Then type Return in the bochs window to continue.  Just continue
doing this until setup is done.  For example:

  [Please insert input volume 2 and hit return]
  unix-> cp USR.01 /path/1.44
  [Return in Bochs window]

  [Please insert input volume 3 and hit return]
  unix-> cp USR.02 /path/1.44
  [Return in Bochs window]

When setup is completed, you should see the message:

  Done.

and a root prompt '#'.  At this point, halt the system and
try one more boot if you'd like:

  # halt

Type a couple Ctrl-C's in the the window you fired up bochs in.
Now fire up Bochs again, this time booting the hard drive directly:

  bochs boot:c

As usual, type '=' to continue the boot process.

Go nuts!
