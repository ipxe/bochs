To provide a forum for the development of the Bochs x86 PC emulation
software, and to keep interested parties apprised of developments,
there is a developer's email list available to anyone willing
to join.  After joining, you may email to <FONT COLOR="#0000ff">bochs-developers@redhat.com</FONT>.  Your email will be sent to EVERYONE on the list.
Keep in mind, if you have questions regarding licensing or
specific business oriented topics, email me directly at
<A HREF="mailto:kevin@bochs.com">

In this case, your email will only be received by me (Kevin Lawton).
