<CENTER><H1>Running &nbsp;./configure</H1></CENTER>

This is a summary of all the possible options to ./configure.
Generally speaking, you can just take the defaults and run
configure without any options.  If you need something
outside of the defaults, consult the following section.
<p>
Note that the configure script sets up the Makefiles to use
the compiler and compiler options from your environment.
You should set 4 environment variables, before calling configure.
For example, in bash:
<pre>
  CC="egcs"
  CXX="$CC"
  CFLAGS="-Wall -O2 -m486 -fomit-frame-pointer -pipe"
  CXXFLAGS="$CFLAGS"

  export CC
  export CXX
  export CFLAGS
  export CXXFLAGS

  ./configure
</pre>
I cheat and use script files to do this for me.  You can look
in files such as ".conf.x86" to see what options I use, and how
I invoke configure.

<p>
This table is divided into the options that most users will need and the
more obscure options.

<table border>
<tr>
  <th>Option</th>
  <th>Defaults to</th>
  <th>Comments</th>
<tr>
  <td>--enable-cpu-level={3,4,5}</td>
  <td>5
  <td>Select which CPU level to emulate.  Choices are 3,4,5 which
      mean target 386, 486 or Pentium emulation.
  </td>
<tr>
  <td>--enable-cdrom</td>
  <td>no
  <td>Enable use of a real CDROM.  The cdrom emulation is always
      present, and emulates a drive without media by default.
      You can use this option to compile in support for accessing
      the media in your workstation's cdrom drive.  The supported
      platforms are Linux, Solaris, OpenBSD, and Windows.
      For other platforms, a small amount of code specific to 
      your platform must be written.  The module
      iodev/cdrom.cc is the place to add more support.  For the
      most part, you need to figure out the right set of ioctl()
      calls.
  </td>
<tr>
  <td>--enable-sb16={<i>dummy, win, linux</i>}</td>
  <td>no
  <td>Enable Sound Blaster emulation. &nbsp;
      SB16 output is only supported for Windows or Linux.  The <i>dummy</i> 
      option means to support an SB16, but don't use
      an output device.  So for example, you might use 
      '--enable-sb16=linux'. Check out <a href="sound.html">sound.html</a> 
      for more info.
      </td>
<tr>
  <td>--enable-cpp</td>
  <td>no
  <td>Use .cpp as C++ suffix.  Moves all the .cc files to .cpp for
      use with compilers which want that, like MS C++ compilers.
      Don't use this option unless you know you need it.</td>
<tr>
  <td>--enable-debugger</td>
  <td>no
  <td>Compile in support for Bochs internal command-line debugger.
      This has nothing to do with x86 hardware debug support.  It
      is a more powerful and non-intrusive native debugger.
      Enabling this will of course slow down the emulation.
      You only need this option if you know you need it.  After
      you have run ./configure, you may want to edit 'config.h'
      to customize the debugger further.  Look at the section
      entitled 'OPTIONAL DEBUGGER SECTION'.</td>
<tr>
  <td>--enable-disasm</td>
  <td>no
  <td>Compile in support for built-in disassembler.  Bochs has
      a built-in disassembler, which is useful if you either
      run the built-in debugger (--enable-debugger), or want
      disassembly of the current instruction when there is a
      panic in bochs.  You don't need this option.</td>
<tr>
  <td>--enable-vga</td>
  <td>yes
  <td>Use VGA emulation.  VGA is the only supported option and
      since it's the default, you don't need to include this option.</td>
<tr>
  <td>--enable-fpu</td>
  <td>no before bugfix2<br>yes for bugfix3 (5/16/2001) and after
  <td>If you want to compile bochs to make use of the FPU emulator
      written by Bill Metzenthen (the one used by the Linux kernel),
      use this option.
  </td>
<tr>
  <td>--enable-x86-debugger</td>
  <td>no
  <td>X86 debugger support.  If the software you run in bochs
      needs to use the x86 hardware debugging facilities such as
      DR0..DR8, instruction and data breakpoints etc., then you
      should use this option.  Otherwise don't use it, as it
      will slow down the emulation.</td>
<tr>
  <td>--with-x11</td>
  <td>yes
  <td>Use X11 GUI.  This is the default and you don't need
      this option if you are using X11.</td>
<tr>
  <td>--with-beos</td>
  <td>no
  <td>Use BeOS GUI.  The configure script will run natively
      on BeOS and use this option when doing so.</td>
<tr>
  <td>--with-win32-vcpp</td>
  <td>no
  <td>Use Win32 GUI/Visual C++ environment.  This is for running
      configure on a platform which supports running configure, so
      that you may then transfer the configured code over to
      an MS Win32/Visual C++ environment.</td>
<tr>
  <td>--with-macos</td>
  <td>no
  <td>Use Macintosh/CodeWarrior environment</td>
<tr>
  <td>--with-nogui</td>
  <td>no
  <td>No native GUI, just use blank stubs.  This is if you don't
      care about having video output, but are just running tests.
      This option may not be up-to-date, but can be made so
      easily.</td>

<CENTER><H1>Other Configure Options</H1></CENTER>
<table border>
<tr>
  <th>Option</th>
  <th>Defaults to</th>
  <th>Comments</th>
<tr>
  <td>--enable-ne2000</td>
  <td>no
  <td>Enable limited ne2000 support.  This requires a low-level
      component to be written for each OS. One is written only
      for FreeBSD so far.  Not complete yet. Don't use this option yet.</td>
<tr>
  <td>--enable-pci</td>
  <td>no
  <td>Enable limited i440FX PCI support.  This is not complete.
      Don't use this option.</td>
<tr>
  <td>--enable-port-e9-hack</td>
  <td>no
  <td>Writes to port e9 go to console.  Unless you know you want
      this option, you don't.</td>
<tr>
  <td>--enable-loader</td>
  <td>no
  <td>Support calling external loader from debugger.  This
      is an unsupported option. Don't use it.</td>
<tr>
  <td>--enable-instrumentation</td>
  <td>no
  <td>Compile in support for instrumentation.  This allows
      you to collect instrumentation data from bochs as
      it executes code.  You have to create your own
      instrumentation library and define the instrumentation
      macros (hooks in bochs) to either call your library
      functions or not, depending upon whether you want
      to collect each piece of data.  [Kevin wrote: I broke 
      some of the hooks when I recoded the fetch/decode loop.
      Contact me if you need this option.]</td>
<tr>
  <td>--enable-simid={0, 1}</td>
  <td>0
  <td>CPU simulator ID.  You likely don't need this
      option.  If you are using bochs to cosimulate, that
      is to run multiple simulators in parallel so that you
      can compare results and check for divergence, each
      simulator needs an ID.  When you only have one CPU
      simulator (as usual) the default of 0 is fine.  I
      use this option occasionally to run 2 versions of
      bochs against each other and check for divergence,
      to find bugs etc.  This option gets broken more than
      not due to architectural changes, and I usually end of fixing
      it each time I use it.  </td>
<tr>
  <td>--enable-num-sim={1, 2}</td>
  <td>1
  <td>Number of CPU simulators.  The default of 1 is likely what
      you want, so don't use this option.  It is for assigning
      an ID to the simulator, for cosimulation described above.</td>
<tr>
  <td>--enable-time0=n</td>
  <td>no
  <td>Start CMOS clock at at time0 of n instead of using time().
      You likely don't want this
      option.  When debugging, it is very helpful to have
      deterministic execution, and the clock is something that
      can skew determinism.  If you supply this option, pass
      it a value returned by the time(NULL) call, relating to
      the time you want bochs to start the CMOS clock from.  For
      instance, '--enable-time0=917385580'.  If you use this option
      but don't provide a value, configure uses a default value.
      Note that the time0 option in .bochsrc will override this value.
      Without this option, the CMOS clock uses a time0 based on
      the value of time(NULL), which is probably what you want.
      </td>
<tr>
  <td>--enable-hga-dumps=Nmicroseconds</td>
  <td>no
  <td>Copy memory to HGA video buffer every N useconds.  A
      deprecated option, don't use.</td>
<tr>
  <td>--with-win32</td>
  <td>no
  <td>Use Win32 GUI.  I think this option was similar to
      --with-win32-vcpp, but for targeting a Win32/gcc
      environment. Deprecated option.</td>
