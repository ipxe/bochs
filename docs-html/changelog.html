  <ul>
  <li>This was the first SourceForge release by Bryce Denney, with patches from many sources on the bochs-developers list.
  <li>add BX_PANIC_IS_FATAL option.  <br>WARNING: Due to a implementation bug, nonfatal panics can create problems.  If you need to use BX_PANIC_IS_FATAL=0, move the bx_atexit() after the return line.  This problem was corrected in CVS after 5/2/2001 but has not made it into a bugfix release yet.

  <li> FPU mods:
    <ul>
    <li> Integrated new FPU emulator mods from Bill Metzenthen.
    <li> Bill ported x86 specific assembly files to C.
    <li> I helped port the FPU emulator to work on big-endian machines.
         (tested on SPARC so far)
    <li> The FPU emulator is now integrated into the main bochs
         source code (in fpu/) for ease of compilation.
    <li> Tested on x86 and SPARC.
    <li> The '--enable-fpu' option no longer needs an argument.

  <li> Sound Blaster 16 emulation.
    <ul>
    <li> Integrated Sound Blaster 16 emulation from Josef Drexler.
    <li> Check out <a href="sound.html">sound.html</a> for SB16 notes.
    <li> Added configure option <a href="configure.html">--enable-sb16=</a>.
    </ul>
  <li> Started work on special guest driver to host interface, which
       will ultimately be used by disk/video/network etc drivers
       to enhance performance in bochs. &nbsp;Not usable yet.

  <ul>
  <li> NT4.0 installs in bochs (Pentium+FPU+CDROM options).
  <li> Please wait until next release for running NT unless you really
       need it.
  <li> Created (incomplete) docs-html/guestNT.html to outline process
       of installing NT4.0 in bochs.
  <li> More fixes to ::exception().
  <li> Fixes to ::stack_return_to_v86().
  <li> Mods to configure to handle win32 config again.
  <li> Integrates mods from win32 developers.
  <li> vga.cc handles variable number of lines in text mode. &nbsp;
       Updated GUI code for all platforms, to receive number of
       lines of text in ::text_update().

</h2>
  <ul>
  <li> Integrated diffs submitted for OpenBSD cdrom support.
  <li> Fixed up v8086 mode and exception handling.
  <li> Fixed real-mode handling of IOPL flag WRT POPF/IRET.
  <li> Fixed handling of a bunch of weird 16/32-bit transitions.
       &nbsp;In the doing, I ended up recoding the following:
    <ul>
    <li> Recoded ::exception()
    <li> Recoded ::interrupt()
    <li> Recoded ::task_switch()
    </ul>
  <li> Cleaned up most warnings.
  <li> Added docs-html/codingguidelines.html.  Please peruse it, if
       you are a code submitter, and would like to comply with
       my code tyranny. :^)
  <li> Integrated new submitted Mac build files and gui code.
  <li> Have a few more issues to take care of before playing
       in the dynamic translation sandbox again.

  <ul>
  <li> CDROM emulation:
    <ul>
    <li> New ./configure option '--enable-cdrom'.  So far, there is
         only support for Linux.
    <li> I created a Linux specific CDROM component.  Mostly
         just ioctl()s needed to access a few functions of the
         cdrom.
    <li> Created 'iodev/cdrom.cc' and 'iodev/cdrom.h' which contain
         the low-level code.  Essentially, all the OS specific code
         is contained in these files.
    <li> Should be fairly easy to add code for other OSes.
    <li> Use .bochsrc directive 'cdromd: dev=/dev/cdrom, status=inserted'.
    <li> Will add an icon for cdrom to the UI later.
    <li> Tested cdrom emulation running Linux in bochs.  Use something
         like 'mount -r /dev/hdb /mnt/cdrom'.  Haven't checked out
         using it in Windows yet.
    </ul>

</h2>
  <ul>
  <li> Moved default cpu level to Pentium.
  <li> Created docs-html/configure.html to explain options to configure.
  <li> Fixes to high-level CDROM support.
  <li> Added optional x86 hardware debug support:
    <ul>
    <li> '--enable-x86-debugger' is a new option to ./configure.
    <li> This is the debug support offered by an x86 CPU,
         not the native bochs debugger.
    <li> Added instruction and data breakpoint capabilities.
    <li> Added proper RF handling with or without hw debugging.
    <li> You can configure without this option for more speed.
    </ul>
  <li> FWAIT now calls FPU emulator like it should.
  <li> Changes to LMSW.
  <li> Moved a bunch of initial stderr messages to bochs.out.
  <li> More Pentium behaviour enhancements.
  <li> Modified HLT instruction.
  <li> GRUB now works in bochs and can load programs.
  <li> Compiled a new wm-FPU-emu version for this bochs version
       (only very minor mods).
  <li> Work on further Pentium emulation continues...
  </ul>

  <ul>
  <li> Added partial Pentium emulation:
    <ul>
    <li> --enable-cpu-level=5 is now possible from ./configure.
    <li> Default level still at 4 without above option.
    <li> Win'95 boots and recognizes Pentium emulation.
    <li> Linux boots and recognizes Pentium emulation.
    </ul>
  <li> Work on further Pentium emulation continues...

</h2>
  <ul>
  <li> Generated new BIOS (bios/BIOS-bochs-990925a).
  <li> Fix to mouse BIOS code (int15h:c2:06:00).  The use of
       local code block/variables is not handled correctly by
       the bcc compiler.  Removed braces, and moved local variable
       to top level of function.
  <li> Fix to extended mem access BIOS function (int15h:87).
       This was killing Minix.
  <li> Fix to floppy.cc, was reading one extra sector.
  <li> Fix to Makefiles etc for compiling without floating point.
  <li> Minix boots again inside bochs.  Though, the keyboard code
       is not yet right for running Minix.  For some reason, if
       you comment out the 2 keyboard ACKs at lines 947 and
       966 in iodev/keyboard.cc, it works.

       Windows'95 splash screen works now! (Craig Ballantyne)
  <li> Addition of postfix expression evaluator in the debugger.
       (Hanish Menon)
  <li> Support for 1.76MB floppies. (Hanish Menon)

  <ul>
  <li> Fixed bug in crc command from debug prompt
  <li> Bochs now can be compiled to use wm-FPU-emu,
       the x87 FPU emulator included in the Linux kernel.  It
       was written by Bill Metzenthen.  Look in fpu.html for
       more info.  Added "--enable-fpu=" to configure.  For now,
       this will only work on x86, since wm-FPU-emu has some
       assembly components.
  <li> Coded illegal instruction exception for old XBTS and IBTS
       opcodes.
  <li> Moved default cpu level to 486.
  <li> Decoupled main web page from user documentation in "docs-html".

  <LI> (ftp://ftp.bochs.com/pub/DT/bochs-990312b.tar.gz)
  <LI> First teaser release with dynamic translation framework!
  <LI> Only a few instructions translated, but the framework
       is coming along nicely.  Read "readme.990312b" in the
       ftp directory above for more info.  I include some
       preliminary performance tests, and you can benchmark
       bochs with dynamic translation on your own machine.
  <LI> Many more optimizations are possible.
  <LI> Here's an excerpt from the readme file:

  <LI> Converted all read-modify-write instructions to use
       RMW versions of write_virtual_xyz() & read_virtual_xyz().
  <LI> Addition of Linux/PPC to successful port matrix.
  <LI> Dynamic translation framework is coming along nicely,
       but not included here yet.  I'll include it soon in
       an upcoming release.
  <LI> Roadrunner OS booted.
  <LI> Integrated many patches from bochs users:
    <UL>
    <LI> Floppy: change line support.
    <LI> Beos: BX_KEY_{LEFT,RIGHT}_ARROW, omitted _ARROW.
    <LI> Bochs port to Cygwin32 without cygnus layer (pure win32 mode).
    <LI> New version of win32.cc, fixes to fetchdecode.cc for win32.
    <LI> Fixes to keyboard.
    <LI> Fixes to X11 cursor problem.
    <LI> Added --enable-port-e9-hack for sending port output to console.
    <LI> New version of macintosh.cc.
    <LI> Changes to allow quoting pathnames in .bochsrc so you
         can have filenames with spaces.
    <LI> Harddrv.cc: implemented command 0x21 as 0x20.

    <LI> Fetch-decode, address resolve, and execute phases are
         all distinct now.
    <LI> Each instruction gets it's parameters from a pointer to
         a structure passed to it.
    </UL>
  <LI> Added '--enable-time0' option to configure.  Use this only
         if you want to always start the cmos clock at the same
         value every time.  This is valuable for reproducable runs.
         It was invaluable to me during cosimulation of this version
         of bochs against an older one to find bugs.
  <LI> Fix in cpu/paging.cc.  Set all segment register descriptor
       caches to invalid, until they were properly loaded.

       Oops, I goofed in bochs-990110a.
  <LI> Redhat 5.2 boot floppy image works again.
  <LI> Incorporated new serial port diffs.
  <LI> Configure senses if you have select().  New macro BX_HAVE_SELECT.
  <LI> Added future configure option '--enable-dynamic-translation'.
       Don't use this, as its not yet supported.
  </UL>
<BR>
<LI><H2><FONT COLOR="#000066">bochs-990110a</FONT></H2>
  <UL>
  <LI> Direct floppy disk access fix.  I was only checking if
       file was a character-special file.  Added check for
       block-special file.
  <LI> Minor fixes for Macintosh platform.
  <LI> Small changes to compile bochs on BeOS R4 for x86 using gcc.
  <LI> Fix to timer framework code in pc_system.cc.

  <LI> Partially integrated mods from some limited i440fx PCI support
    <UL>
    <LI> A few more mods to integrate, DON'T USE YET
    <LI> Added '--enable-pci' to ./configure and BX_PCI_SUPPORT macro
    <LI> Added 'i440fxsupport: enabled=' option to .bochsrc
    </UL>
  <LI> Added settable BX_SHADOW_RAM macro to config.h.in, in case
       your software counts on C0000..FFFFF being writable.
  <LI> Added 'cmosimage:' option to .bocshrc.  If you use this,
       an image file is read into CMOS registers upon startup.
       Then certain values are written over, as the IO devices
       initialize.  Not complete yet.  DON'T USE YET
  <LI> Added 'newharddrivesupport: enabled=' option to .bochsrc.
       Set this to 0 or 1.  If set to 1, some new hard drive commands
       are accepted and some behaviour is changed per some diffs I
       received.  After I have time to look at these more, I'll
       integrate them permanently and get rid of this option.
  <LI> Some fixes to keyboard/floppy/hard-drive support.
  <LI> Rehashed the CMOS code.  Now support the RTC, interval timer
       and alarm clock.  This code has not been tested properly.
  <LI> Rehashed the bochs native timer support which some of
       the IO devices use.
  </UL>

  <LI>Rehashed paging.cc and TLB.  Fixed problem with dirty bit not
      being set after a read operation cached an entry in the TLB.

  <UL>
  <LI>added '--with-nogui' option to configure to run without any GUI.  Also provides
      documentation for the GUI specific functions.
  <LI>recoded the PS2 mouse BIOS and some mouse hardware emulation.  Mouse now
      works on X11.  Haven't implemented it for BeOS yet.  Double click timing
      doesn't work yet though.
  <LI>(possibly) fixed the panic during Win'95 install due to keyboard.
  <LI>added private_colormap option to .bochsrc.  requests a non-shared
      colormap from your GUI.  Only implemented on X11 so far.
  <LI>added mouse option to .bochsrc.  Not implemented yet for any of
      the GUI specific modules, but it will request that mouse events not
      be generated by the GUI.
  <LI>changed palette change technique to tell GUI of each individual
      palette element change.  The GUI has a chance now, to tell
      the VGA code if a redraw of the screen is necessary.  Redraw
      is not necessary if using a private colormap.

  <LI>BIOS floppy read/write fix.  AH was not being set.
  <LI>moved config.h:BX_PROCESSOR_IPS to .bochsrc 'ips' directive.
      Now you can run the same binary on different speed machines
      of the same type.  Just tune the 'ips' directive.
  <LI>converted vga.bdf font to bitmaps for use with BeOS.
      The BeOS module no longer uses any BeOS system fonts,
      but just includes the bitmaps in the source code.
  <LI>included patches for 980118.
  <LI>Changed 'mips' field to 'm_ips'.  Hopefully, this
      will fix compiles for MIPS processor based machines.
