Compiling Bochs on a Win32 platform
</H1>
You can compile bochs on your Win32 machine!
<P>
Coding of the GUI module and the original port were done by David Ross.  See
<A HREF="http://www.v.nu/core/Bochs">David Ross's Win32 Bochs port</A>
<P>

<H2>
Compiling Bochs on your Win32 system with MS Visual C++
</H2>
The original port used batch files to build in each directory.  I've
extended this, by allowing the configuration script "./configure" to
create all the Makefiles and config files needed to compile with
NMAKE on your Win32 system.  Though, in order to use "./configure",
you need access to a system which can run it.  Use a Unix
system, or perhaps the GNU-Win32 layer below.
This step is needed only for the configuration step.  You then bring the
source tree over to your Win32 system, and NMAKE will make the
entire tree, and produce a BOCHS.EXE file.
<P>
Currently, you can use all the configure options, <B>except</B> the
"--enable-debugger".  This will change, as I only need to change the
Makefile for the debugger, so that it leaves the C files for the
lexer/parser.
<P>
Look in "bochs-yymmdd/.conf.win32-vcpp" for the very few commands
to configure for your win32/MS Visual C++ platform.
<P>
Then move the entire distribution over to your Win32 system.
I suggest the following steps, but many other options are available.
<UL>
<LI>tar it
<LI>gzip it
<LI>FTP it over from Unix to Win32
<LI>C:\> MKDIR C:\BOCHS
<LI>use PKWARE's excellent utility to extract it. (C:\> PKZIP25 -extract -directories file.tgz)
<LI>use NMAKE to compile the whole distribution (C:\bochs\bochs-yymmdd> NMAKE)
<LI>copy the ".bochsrc" file to "bochsrc", and edit it
<LI>if you don't already have a disk image file, create one on a Unix system
    and transfer it over.
<LI>start the program.  (C:\bochs\bochs-yymmdd\BOCHS.EXE)
</UL>
