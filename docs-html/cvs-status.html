This is a list of changes which are in the CVS tree but not in the latest
release.

  <ul>
  <li> I'm just about to make 1.2-pre1, a pre-release of version 1.2, along
  with source tars and binary packages.  Once this is out, all the changes in
  CVS (even SMP) will be in the latest release.
  <li> The SMP branch has been merged into the main line, as of 5/23/2001 or so.
  </ul>
