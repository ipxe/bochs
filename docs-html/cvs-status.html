<li><h2>
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=12580">Current CVS tree</a> (these notes updated 5/9/2001)
</h2>
  <ul>
  <li> Fixed BX_PANIC_IS_FATAL bug, described below.  Also fixed bx_panic bug that would silently discard panic messages if the logfd had not been opened yet (such as while parsing .bochsrc).
  <li> implement diskd (second hard drive).  You cannot have both a diskd and a cdromd
  <li> applied Todd Fries' patch to add support for 2.88 floppy image
  <li> applied Todd Fries' patch to do software reset instead of panic
  <li> add --with-term GUI mode. uses text mode display only
  <li> add --enable-split-hd.  Split hard drive mode allows several partial disk image files (e.g. win95-1, win95-2, win95-3) to be treated as one large file, so that you can store each partition in a separate file, if you get the file sizes to match the partition table boundaries.  Split hard disk patch requires a new rombios, BIOS-bochs-2001_0509.
  </ul>

There are also two active branches in addition to the main branch, 
BRANCH-smp-bochs and BRANCH-io-cleanup.  

<ul>
<li>
The SMP bochs branch allows
Bochs to simulate a multiple processor machine.  It does NOT make Bochs
perform better or run in different CPUs on a real SMP machine.  This branch 
will be integrated into the main source tree in the near future.  It has
not been tested much since REL-smpbochs-04-03-2001, but has most of the
same bug fixes and features that the main branch had on 5/8/2001.  Est. time 
frame to merge: next weekend 5/20.
<li>
The I/O cleanup branch was created 5/10 by Todd and Bryce, who are working
on revamping the bochs logging code.  Since this involved so many files 
and several commits, we are working on a branch to keep the main code
clean until the new I/O code is ready.  Time frame to merge: end of this 
weekend (5/13).
