  <ul>
  <li> Fixed BX_PANIC_IS_FATAL bug, described below.  Also fixed bx_panic bug that would silently discard panic messages if the logfd had not been opened yet (such as while parsing .bochsrc).
  <li> implement diskd (second hard drive).  You cannot have both a diskd and a cdromd
  <li> applied Todd Fries' patch to add support for 2.88 floppy image
  <li> applied Todd Fries' patch to do software reset instead of panic
  <li> add --with-term GUI mode. uses text mode display only
  <li> add --enable-split-hd.  Split hard drive mode allows several partial disk image files (e.g. win95-1, win95-2, win95-3) to be treated as one large file, so that you can store each partition in a separate file, if you get the file sizes to match the partition table boundaries.  Split hard disk patch requires a new rombios, BIOS-bochs-2001_0509.
