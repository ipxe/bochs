<BR><B><FONT COLOR="#000066">Q: Is bochs Open Source?.</FONT></B>
<BR><b>Yes!</b> &nbsp;Thanks <u>very</u> much to
    <a href="http://www.linux-mandrake.com">MandrakeSoft</a>, producers of
    the much acclaimed Linux-Mandrake distribution. &nbsp;They
    have enabled bochs to be made Open Source, and I have become
    part of their team, working on plex86/bochs.  Bochs is now released
    under the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lesser.html">GNU LGPL</a>.

<BR>
<BR><B><FONT COLOR="#000066">Q: Who is the author of bochs?</FONT></B>
<BR>Well, I'm (Kevin Lawton) the primary author
    of bochs.  There have been bug fixes, enhancements, and
    code contributions from some few hundred people to date.
    Support has been incredible!  And it's growing.  Without
    it, I would have quit years ago.

<BR>
<BR><B><FONT COLOR="#000066">Q: How do you pronounce "bochs"?</FONT></B>
<BR>Phonetically the same as the English word "box".  It's just
    a play on the word "box", since techies like to call their
    machines a "Linux box", "Windows box", ...  Bochs emulates
    a box inside a box.

<BR>
<BR><B><FONT COLOR="#000066">Q: Tell me about peformance when running bochs?</FONT></B>
<BR><I>Up to now</I>, bochs has exclusively used interpreter
    emulation technology; fetch in an instruction, decode,
    then execute it.  I am currently in the process of adding
    dynamic translation, which allows for small x86 code sequences
    to be translated into native CPU code sequences, on-the-fly.
    This native code is cached, so it can be run any number of
    times thereafter.  There's an architecture neutral part
    to the dynamic translation, and an architecture specific
    part (back-end).  There needs to be a back-end for each
    platform bochs runs on.  It's too early for me to comment
    on performance using dynamic translation.  But, I have tested
    a few code sample, and I walked away with a smile on my face.
    I'm hoping to release the framework for this in the next
    release or two.  It won't have many instructions translated,
    but those will be added incrementally, and quickly, once the
    framework is stable.  The first backends will support
    Linux/x86 and BeOS/x86.  Probably SPARC after that.  It
    would be helpful if I could get a high-end PPC platform
    loaner.  Multiple CPU's would be wonderful, but not essential.
    I'll need one for writing a back-end for it.
    Also, I want to add threading to bochs.  At some point, I want to
    put certain parts (optionally) in their own thread.  Also,
    I believe with very careful lightweight thread communication,
    it may be possible to thread the CPU emulation itself.
    This idea was suggested on the developer's email list.
<P> So, back to your question.  If you need speed, wait for
    dynamic translation.  In interpreted mode, I get approximately
    1.5MIPS using bochs on my 400Mhz PII Linux machine.  In dynamic
    translation mode, you will see a lag as bochs encounters
    new code, then it'll get snappy and run at a much higher
    rate than in interpreted mode.

<BR>
<BR><B><FONT COLOR="#000066">Q: Does bochs use a disk partition to install the OS?</FONT></B>
<BR>No.  You use a disk image file, which is simply a large
   file, like any other file,  on your platform's disk.

<BR>
<BR><B><FONT COLOR="#000066">Q: Why can't I use Bochs with my current Win95 installation?</FONT></B>
<BR>Think about this.  If you had two different PC's, they
   would require different hardware drivers.  So you may not
   be able to safely move a disk drive with Win95 on it, from
   one to the other.  Bochs is no different.  It emulates
   a certain set of hardware devices, and requires each OS
   be configured for those devices.

<BR><B><FONT COLOR="#000066">Q: Is there a developer's email list for bochs?</FONT></B>
<BR>Yes.  For instructions on joining, go to
    <A HREF="developers.html">Developers email-list.</A>

<BR>
<BR><B><FONT COLOR="#000066">Q: Is there an irc channel for bochs?</FONT></B>
<BR>Not that I am aware of.

<BR>
<BR><B><FONT COLOR="#000066">Q: Do you know of any snapshots of Bochs running Win95?</FONT></B>
<BR>There are some on external project sites.  Look at the
   main bochs web page under "What is Bochs" or other topic.
   I don't include any, because I'm trying to keep the web site
   very low bandwidth.

<BR>
<BR><B><FONT COLOR="#000066">Q: Does bochs support a CDROM?</FONT></B>
<BR>Not yet.  However you can use the "mtools" package on quite
   a few platforms, to copy files from your CDROM to a disk image
   file.  Make sure to comply with all software copyright issues.

<BR>
<BR><B><FONT COLOR="#000066">Q: Does bochs support a sound device?</FONT></B>
<BR>Not yet.  There are efforts in this area going on by
   contributing authors.  The emulation is of a Sound Blaster.

<BR>
<BR><B><FONT COLOR="#000066">Q: Does bochs support a network card?</FONT></B>
<BR>Not yet.  There are also efforts in this area going on by
   contributing authors.  The emulation is of an NE2000 NIC,
   and I'm told it's quite far along.

<BR>
<BR><B><FONT COLOR="#000066">Q: What applications are known to run inside of bochs?</FONT></B>
<BR>Well, lot's of different OS's run inside of bochs, so
   thousands.  I'm assuming your asking about Windows programs.
   To give you a few, the following ones from the Winstone'98 tests
   worked:
<UL>
<LI>Access 97</LI>
<LI>CorelDRAW! 7</LI>
<LI>Excel 97</LI>
<LI>Lotus 1-2-3 97</LI>
<LI>Word 97</LI>
<LI>PowerPoint 97</LI>
<LI>Quattro Pro 7</LI>
<LI>WordPerfect 7</LI>
</UL>

Also, I've compiled an entire OS kernel inside bochs before.  Not
to mention, running DOOM, though at then-pathetic speeds.
