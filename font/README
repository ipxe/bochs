The file "hercules.bdf" is a font file I created using "vga.bdf"
as a base.

"vga.bdf" is composed of characters which are 8 pixels wide by 16 pixels high.
I needed to go to 9 pixels wide by 14 pixels high, so I chopped the top
and bottom row of pixels off, and added another column in width.

A few characters I moved down a pixel, since I had to chop the top tow off,
and otherwise they would have lost information.

On the Hercules, the 9th column is not stored in ROM.  For characters,
0 to 191, and 224 to 255, a blank column is generated.  For characters,
192.223 the 8th column is repeated, so I added those pixels as
would be expected.
