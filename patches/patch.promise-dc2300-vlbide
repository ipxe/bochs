Detailed description:

This patch adds Promise DC2300 VLB IDE Support.
You may find msdos and win95 drivers on the net. Look for
P2300W95.ZIP and DC2300VLBIDEver260b.ZIP.

The good news is that now win95 natively sees my cdrom,
and that the disks are not in msdos compatibility mode any more.

The bad news is that it works only for the first ata interface.

I tested that patch on msdos and win95 only.
