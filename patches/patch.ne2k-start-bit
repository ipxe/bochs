Detailed description:
I compiled Bochs on Linux and installed a linux
in it, but when I ping a machine on my LAN, I get
packet loss. Sometimes as much as 70% is lost.
So I read ne2k.cc, Linux 8390 driver and 8390 chip
specification. I find that 8390 command register START
bit is misused in ne2k.cc. According to the chip
specification, even if START=0, the chip does not stop
working. 

Bryce messed up version 1.1 of this patch.  Version 1.2 should be
what ecelca@yahoo.com intended.


Patch was created with:
  cvs diff -c
Apply patch to what version:
  CVS
Instructions:
  To patch, go to main bochs directory.
  Type "patch -p0 < THIS_PATCH_FILE".
