I've used the file "HEADER" as a template for the comments at the top
of a patch.


Here's how to patch the bochs 3/25/2000 snapshot.
Uses Bourne shell syntax (sh, bash, etc.)

# do portable1 and portable2 first, others can go in any order.

PATCHES="patch.portable1 patch.portable2 patch.const64bit patch.fabs-conflict patch.hd-abort-features patch.inlines patch.macos-no-strdup patch.mouse-fix-linux-bsd patch.panic-is-fatal patch.pit-panic patch.sun-cdrom patch.vga-3c3 patch.win32-rawcd patch.win32-rawfloppy patch.copyrights2"

for p in $PATCHES; do patch -p1 patches/$p ; done
# expect conflicts in configure script.  No surprise, just run autoconf again
# to recreate it.
rm -f configure.rej
autoconf

# check for failed patches.  Expect to get one reject from debug/lexer.c.
# It's not a big deal.
find . -name '*.rej'
