Patch name: patch.ltdl-win32-search-path
Author: Hartmut Birr <hartmut.birr@tesionmail.de>

Detailed description:
it seems that the search algorithm for dll's (plugin's) on win32 is a
little bit dirty. The search starts at first in the system directory and
at last in the current directory. There is found a vga.dll in the system
directory wich doesn't work with bochs. I've add a patch to ltdl.c, that
will first open the dll without the given path and if this fail the dll
is opened from the provided path. With this hack, bochs works perfect
for me. I use mingw/msys for compiling.


Patch was created with:
  cvs diff -u
Apply patch to what version:
  cvs checked out on DATE, release version VER
Instructions:
  To patch, go to main bochs directory.
  Type "patch -p0 < THIS_PATCH_FILE".
