All versions of Bochs can be downloaded from the Bochs website at
<a href="http://bochs.sourceforge.net"> http://bochs.sourceforge.net </a>.
On the web site, you can download Bochs, learn about
the bochs-developers mailing list, submit bug reports, and much more.

<b>What files are installed?</b>
</font>
<BR>
When you install a Bochs binary release for win32, you get the Bochs
executables and tools, ROM image files, documentation, and a sample disk image
that allows Bochs to boot Linux.  Once you unzip the Bochs ZIP file, here is a
list of the files that are installed, and a brief description of each one.  The
files which can be viewed in text form are shown as links.

<a name="quickstart">

<font face="arial, helvetica" color="#1e029a" size="4">
<b>How can I try out Bochs in 5 minutes or less?</b>
</font>
<BR>
This package includes a sample disk image of DLX Linux, which you can boot
within Bochs.  Use the Windows Explorer to find c:\bochs\dlxlinux\start.bat,
and double-click start.bat.  This will launch two windows: one is the Bochs
Display window, and the other is text window that shows Bochs log messages.  
You may notice that your mouse pointer has disappeared into the Bochs window.  
Press F12 to get the cursor back.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, the Bochs display screen looks like a PC booting, and in fact it is!
Bochs begins simulating a PC from the time the power turns on.  You will see
the VGA BIOS message, and it begins loading Linux from the disk image.  (The
disk image is just a big file that Bochs uses as if it were a real hard drive.)
After a while, you see Linux boot messages and eventually a login prompt.  You
are now running Linux in a window!
<br><br>
Bochs simulates every instruction of an x86 CPU, so it is very memory- and
compute-intensive.  The speed of your real CPU will make a big difference in
how fast the DLX Linux image boots.  On a 750MHz Pentium, the sample Linux 
image takes about 25 seconds to boot.
<br><br>
Booting is complete when you see "dlx login:" and a cursor.  At this login
prompt, type "root".  On UNIX systems, root is the system admin user.
There is no password for root on this image, so it lets you log in 
immediately.  Now you should see a UNIX prompt, and you can begin to
type UNIX commands.

<br>
One thing you may notice is that the screen saver (blank screen) turns on very
quickly when you have stopped typing.  What's happening is that Bochs always
simulates as fast as it can.  If the CPU is very busy (running instructions
nonstop), simulated time goes by slowly.  If the CPU is idle, for example
waiting for a keypress, simulated time speeds up dramatically.  If the screen
saver blanks out the screen, just press a key (shift or control) to restore the
screen.
<br>
<br>

When you get tired of playing with UNIX, just type "reboot" to shut
down the Linux operating system.  You can also press the "Power" button to stop the simulation.

<b>What tools are included in this package?</b>
</font>
<BR>
There are two tools for win32: bximage and sb16ctrl.  
Bximage is a small program that helps to create empty floppy disk 
and hard disk images.  To use it, you should run bximage in an MSDOS window.
(You could also double-click on it, but then you won't be able to read the last
few lines of output before the window disappears.)  Just CD to the directory
where you want the disk images to go, and run bximage.  Bximage will ask you
some questions about what type of disk image you need, and then create one for
you.
<br><br>

The other tool for windows is called sb16ctrl, and it is used to configure
the Bochs emulated sound blaster.  (If you know any more about it please 
post a description to bochs-developers.)
