Notes for the Win32 Port
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I changed things around so you can use a Unix machine to
create the Makefiles and config files for use with MS Visual C++ 5.0
Please check out "docs-html/win32.html"

------- original text from David Ross -----------------------------------
- Visual C++ 5.0 is required to build this release.
-
- Unfortunately there are no makefiles yet.  In each directory where
- a build.bat file exists, you must type "BUILD" to build the libraries.
- The directories are: memory, gui, iodev, and cpu.  After you have done
- this, type "BUILD" in the main directory to compile the remaining files
- and link bochs.exe.
