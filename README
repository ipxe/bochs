Bochs Pentium Emulator
Upated: Fri Apr  6 15:47:04 EDT 2001
Version: bugfix-20010406-beta

Since the number of patches on SourceForge is getting large, I collected
them all into this snapshot file.  Once we get the source moved into
public CVS, it will be much easier to manage.

Please try compiling and running Bochs with this beta version.
If you have to hack it to make it compile or run, please submit your
diffs to sourceforge.  Be sure to mention that the diff should be
applied to bugfix-20010406-beta.  If you don't have diff, do a make
all-clean, and send a ZIP or TAR of the whole directory to Bryce.

The following patches were applied to bochs-2000_0325a.tar.gz from
ftp.bochs.com:

  patch.portable1
  patch.portable2
  patch.const64bit
  patch.fabs-conflict
  patch.hd-abort-features
  patch.inlines
  patch.macos-no-strdup
  patch.mouse-fix-linux-bsd
  patch.panic-is-fatal
  patch.pit-panic
  patch.sun-cdrom
  patch.vga-3c3
  patch.win32-rawcd
  patch.win32-rawfloppy
  patch.copyrights2

The changes in these patches came from many different sources,
including Don Becker (win32-VC++ port, fpu portability), Greg
Alexander (mouse, hard drive, vga fixes), Roland Mainz (sun cdrom),
and others on bochs-developers@redhat.com.

For a summary of fixed bugs, see BUGS.txt.  A copy of all the patches
can be found in the patches directory.  All patches are, of course,
open for discussion.  If you think a patch is an incomplete or poor
solution to a problem, improve it and share your changes.

Whether you have success or failure with this version, please send
feedback to bochs-developers@redhat.com or post a bug report or patch
on sourceforge.  Please don't send bugs to Kevin, since he's working
on plex86 now.  Before making an "official" release, we must verify
that it compiles and runs on a variety of target hosts, and that a
variety of guest operating systems functions correctly in emulation.
So please, report your results!

Have fun,
Bryce Denney
