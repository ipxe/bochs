TODO (know issues in CPU model):
-------------------------------

[!] The following 3DNow! instructions still not implemented:
	PF2IW_PqQq
	PFNACC_PqQq
	PFPNACC_PqQq
	PFCMPGE_PqQq
	PFCMPGT_PqQq
	PFCMPEQ_PqQq
	PFMIN_PqQq
	PFMAX_PqQq
	PFRCP_PqQq
	PFRSQRT_PqQq
	PFSUB_PqQq
	PFSUBR_PqQq
	PFADD_PqQq
	PFACC_PqQq,
	PFMUL_PqQq
	PFRCPIT1_PqQq
	PFRSQIT1_PqQq
	PFRCPIT2_PqQq

[!] CPUID does not report 3DNow! instruction set

[!] Some of APIC functionality still not implemented, for example

    - Globally disabled APIC
    - NMI, SMI, INIT signals, LVT pins handling 
    - Filter interrupts according processor priority (PPR)

[!] REP NOP is PAUSE (on P4/XEON)

    When running in SMP mode, this means that we are in a spin loop.
    This processor should yield to the other one, as we are anyhow waiting
    for a lock, and any other processor is responsible for this.

[!] CLFLUSH instructin should not crash in case of EXECUTE-ONLY segment
    access (according to AMD manuals)

[!] AMD and Intel x86_64 implementations are different. 
    Currently Bochs emulation is according to Intel version.
    Do we need to support both ?

[!] More flexible CPUID - vendor and etc

[!] SSE4A, SSE5, VMX, SVM
